I asked this because I was so shocked to meet fellow T2 who was put on meds but wasnt instructed to religiously track their BS and just test their A1c every 3-6 months. My own doctor recommended to check my BS maybe once a day and a nutritionist recommended atleast 60g of carbs every meal. I think those advises are wrong. We should check our BS religiously even when on meds and go for the lowest Carbs gram as you can. I think 40-60g carbs a day is ideal 

I keep scratching my head when a T2 act surprise to find out when their A1c climbs up.  

If you religiously check your BS you should have an idea where your A1c is sitting at.

In fact some glucometer roughly calculates your A1c level based on the numbers input. I think even just 1 week of doing it your glucometer can give you an estimate A1c. Apps can also do that for you. 

Also it is important to religiously check your BS because eventually you will be able to figure out which foods you are eating raises/lower your BS. And based your diet on that.

Yes exercise definitely helps but counting carbs/sugar is they key. 

I think that a mandatory counting carbs/sugar classes should be implemented when diagnosed with Diabetes and checking BS religiously should be a requirement.",Topic 7,20-Feb,noncovid,/r/diabetes/comments/fanr2c/i_think_i_screwed_my_self/fj1if9w/,0

fj3kvyk,4thshift,2020-02-29 6:30,"Like I said, it is different for different people. And it comes and goes randomly with varying intensity from season to season. Some people are annoyed by it and some people are driven to the worst of all solutions, but IMO, the solution for RLS/PLMD is the same as diabetic blood sugars. If you can avoid the bad inputs, everything else is made easier. 

I had RLS since I was 20, and it just got worse and worse. I was late every day for work and suicidal and I could not make sense of it â€” all before the WWW existed.

I started doing process of eliminator diet tests, because I was convinced it was dietary. And lo and behold â€” chocolate. So, I quit chocolate. But then it kept happening, and my social and health habit kicks changed a lot. So, then it turned out Iâ€™d go to the club and have a couple drinks to be social and it was like I was hooked up to a battery later on. So, I quit drinking. Better, much better â€” but still happening. And so, I tried different food products and it turned out that very specific diet soda products were the problem. I figured it was caffeine, but no, it was from the non-caffeinated diet sodas. 

And so, I had a life of mood cycles and decided with all the TV commercials for happy pills, that there must be a solution for me â€” â€œLook, itâ€™s science! Everybody is taking them. Why canâ€™t I try it?â€ And omg, it was horrible â€” worst ever RLS and they never worked to relieve my mood. Turns out it cycles regardless and I feel better when I feel better and worse when I feel worse â€” nothing I can do but wait it out.

Now, there were ads for RLS finally, but I had had enough meds, and found a mostly decent solution. RLS is somehow connected to my seasonal allergies, too, but I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s the pollen or the antihistamines. Different people will tell you different. But doctors, like yours, are mostly clueless. And primarily will just keep suggesting more meds. They donâ€™t know â€” some specialist might help you, but the meds are serious business â€” like Parkinsonâ€™s meds. And, personally â€” I think most people can skip over the problem by eliminating the causes. Itâ€™s not easy to figure out the cause, as any website discussing the matter will tell you â€” the list is long. But if you want to feel better, thereâ€™s ways other than jumping around and punching yourself in the leg and wondering if you will ever have any relief. If you are messing with dopamine and seratonin from foods or meds, thatâ€™s where Id suggest.

I live near Disney so I canâ€™t call Disney a â€œfree zoneâ€ or my a1c would skyrocket, but imo, allowing yourself the occasional period where you put diabetes on the back burner isnâ€™t the end of the world.  

Personal example.  I generally keep my fasting level at 115 and post meals below 150.  For the week of Christmas, I relaxed and just enjoyed.  My fasting crept up to 125-130 and I had a couple of 190s post meals but it was 1 week and as soon as it was over, I was back on the wagon and quickly back to my normal numbers.

What I am understanding from your post is that you are a newly diagnosed type II diabetic as of only 1 week ago, and are looking for advice on how your Metformin is supposed to work. Metformin is the most common oral medication (hypoglycemic) for type II diabetes. It works by reducing glucose production in the liver as well as blocking its absorption in the intestines. This medication should start working in 48 hours, with best results being after 5 to 7 days. If you are concerned that this time period is not being met, it would be best to phone your doctor for a consultation. I am not a doctor, nor should my opinion take the place of doctor orders or recommendations. Please see your doctor for a plan of care.

Some like to use the term ""controlled"" while others will call it a ""complete reversal"" but I am just curious if a controlled/reversed type 2 diagnosis is still a immune suppressed risk in relation to covid19? I understand no one is immune to contracting the virus, but the CDC does highlight a few high risk populations.

As soon as I was diagnosed last year with diabetes and hypertension, I lost 80 pounds, am no longer considered obese and remain on a healthy diet, free of sugar/high carb. My doctor confirmed that these changes did bring my A1c to a reversed diabetes state. I do however still have hypertension despite diet and light exercise.

 Does the CDC warning online only relate to active type 1 and 2 diabetes or should I still be extra cautious as well? I ask because I am a grad student currently completing clinical rotations at a hospital in NY. Our classes will go fully online in the coming weeks but we're told clinic rotations will continue as normal. Should I voice my concern of being exposed to patients who may have it, or will I be ok to continue for the last 6 weeks of rotation there?

fklrxls,4thshift,2020-03-15 16:00,"If your GAD range is probably supposed to be below 5.0 and you are at 200, then why is anyone saying you are Type 2? You can have â€œnormalâ€ C-peptide and have autoimmune diabetes. In the early days Of T1D you can have normal C-peptide, especially if it is â€œstimulated.â€ C-peptide, to me, is almost a secondary measure after autoantibodies â€” if it is abnormally low, then probably Type 1, if it is abnormally high, probably Type 2; if it is normal or marginally low or high, inconclusive. So, GAD65 is the most common autoantibody associated with Type 1 and you say you are 18 and you lost a lot of weight, and you are on insulin.... Whomever keeps saying you are Type 2 needs to explain their belief. There are 4 more autoantibodies they can test for. The more you have the more assured you are autoimmune diabetic.

As far as insulin, there is a â€œhoneymoon periodâ€ where one has declining output of endogenous insulin from their pancreas. It doesnâ€™t all get killed off at once. And also, Type 1 are not  incapable of developing insulin resistance. Canâ€™t tell you which is the root of your concern â€” if you are gaining weight and your glucose keeps going higher, that may be indicative of insulin resistance or if you are taking like more than 50 units per day, but it all depends on your physiology.

This doctor, are they a general practitioner? They are not specialized in diabetes and often label every person who's not a child a type 2 when they come in with diabetes symptoms, and their knowledge is far too basic. An endocrinologist is a specialist who exclusively treats the endocrine system, which diabetes is a part of. You should listen to your endo over your GP here.

C-peptide can be high in the early stages of autoimmune diabetes because the body is trying super hard to lower your glucose and it's like overclocking your beta-cells. Sometimes a person is also insulin resistant and deficient, meaning the pancreas is still trying to work overtime to meet your insulin needs (reading as a higher value) but it's not enough to prevent ketosis and cause weight loss and other ketosis symptoms.

If your GAD is positive, you experienced weight loss, and your endo says you are a type 1, then you are most likely a type 1. Remember that the numbers we use to diagnose are averages we observe in patients and use as a diagnostic tool, outliers are normal. I had a low c-peptide reading (1.08) with a high fasting glucose, but tested negative for the singular antibody test they gave me, but I'm not insulin resistant and am definitely insulin deficient now.

fj97p0,a1c-were-going-down,2020-03-15 14:48,"December, 2018. Found back from blood work I had an A1C of 7.4, and I was a diabetic with high blood pressure. It sucked. I was 34, and I felt I had so much time ahead of me. I should've known better. I should've been more careful of my family history. I should've paid more attention to my body, and not just my career.

I thought of it two ways. I could kick myself. I could remain mad. I could say ""fuck it"" and just eat whatever I wanted. After all, diabetes or not, no one is escaping death, ultimately. If I wanted to stay around a little longer, I had to do something now before the problems set in and it started to destroy me. My mind went back to a good quote by Marcus Aurelius from *Meditations*:  


&gt; Objective judgment, now at this very moment. Unselfish action, now at this very moment. Willing acceptanceâ€”now at this very momentâ€”of all external events. Thatâ€™s all you need.

So, I got serious about tracking what I was putting into my body. I logged everything, best I could. There are some things I just guesstimate, or I know how much to leave left over calories wise, but I was able to narrow it down with trial and error. You get out what you put in -- and I intended to know what was going in. (Also, I never even realized how caloricly dense cheese was before then.)

When I started seriously in late December, into January, 2019, I started with mornings at around 165-170 mg/dl without medication. Blood pressure sitting at about 135/90. My after meals were never horrible, but at the time I was hitting about an average of 170. 

Today, I'm down about 90 pounds. My mornings average around 110. I've had a good week or two where I was hitting 90s consistently, but I seem to be back to 110. After meals, my average is around 105-110 -- oddly better than my morning levels, with a blood pressure averaging about 120/80. (It may even be lower, as I don't check it as frequently as I used to.) My last A1C was 5.4, and based on my dailies being lower since that check, I'm expecting it to come back lower. (My next big step is to add exercise, as this has been mostly diet based.)

I've been lurking around here for some time, mostly just reading. I know y'all face much steeper challenges than I do, or even ever did. I know my story is not nearly as noteworthy as some of the others on here. Still, for those out there doing what you can to fight; don't give up. There will be plenty of time to give up the fight when you're done and gone.

My name's Judd, I'm a US filmmaker currently living in New Zealand.  Full disclosure - I do not have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, but after having a lot of friends and family who manage both type 1 and type 2, and after my dad told me he was diagnosed as prediabetic, I took a great interest in learning more.  It eventually led to me making an 8 part documentary series, a youtube channel, and an accompanying comprehensive program that includes guides and cookbooks.  

I just wanted to introduce myself and my program, Diabetes Smarts, in case anyone was interested in checking it out.  I've worked hard to create a comprehensive docu series and accompanying program that fully explains diabetes, and offers some concrete, natural, and lasting steps to take to improve your blood glucose control, possibly lose weight, and even perhaps lower your A1C to below the diabetic threshold on a permanent basis.

Thanks for reading guys, and, yeah, if you have any questions or thoughts about the series, I'm happy to chat.

Usually we see patients after it's been too late because they refer women by the time they can't handle it and the fetus is well past the important developmental stage.  Most women go on to have healthy babies without complications.

A pregnancy will fluctuate your sugars like crazy.  Early on you will experience a lot of hyperglycemia, but as you move into your 2nd trimester you will experience more episodes of hypoglycemia.  Get into an MFM quick and speak with a CDE to help you get your diabetes under control.  They will likely put you on insulin and try to stay ahead of the blood sugar trends during a pregnancy.

My first endo that diagnosed me said I was T1 just based on the fact that I got it when I was 12 (or that was when we found out). When my mom took me for a second opinion, the doctor immediately recognized that I was T2 from the bloodwork and tests he did and i was gradually taken off of the insulin that the first doc put me on. Still, the second doctor was very popular and would always be in a rush to try to fit walk-ins into his schedule, so there wasnâ€™t much listening involved on his end.

In the meantime your primary doctor can order what's called a Calcium Scoring Test, this will measure how much arterial disease you have around your heart, which is a huge indicator on if you have a blockage.   


Also, be sure to keep your glucose in control,  the more sugar in the blood the thicker it is and thus makes the heart work harder to pump it around the body.

There are many review sites for physicians and you shouldn't feel bad about telling an endo you don't want to schedule a follow-up because you're going another route. Or just make the appointment they want you to and cancel it the next day. 

You won't need a dedicated cardiologist unless they find a cardiac issue that requires it. Just go to your PCP and tell them what's going on, they'll take it from there. This is probably a great time to go, if there's no large active coronavirus outbreak in your area - most people have probably panic cancelled their appointments so you'll likely find their schedule wide open. Just wash your hands and don't touch your face. 

Definitely don't ever go to the ER for any reason whatsoever if you can possibly avoid it - you'll get bad care (most ER docs are not diabetic specialists, that's for sure) unless you're there for acute trauma.

After 15 min test again and see what the difference is. After another 45min test again and compare. Then test again at the 2 hour mark and compare.

26 M here. I've been a diagnosed type 2 for about a year and a half. The past two weeks my BG hasn't gone over 300, but I had a long period where it was over 200 for quite awhile.
I guess you could say that the whole coronavirus thing had me scared straight. I'm working from home and find myself only really eating at meal times and working standing up, walking around the house when possible (I work on events so ny workload has basically been nonexistent).
That being said, I did want to know what a ""safe"" range for BG is as to not harm my immune system. I've been getting plenty of rest and drinking TONS of water. Again, paranoia since the daughter has daycare (only 5 or 6 kids actually there right now) and the wife works at a bank so she's out and about, but their lobby is closed.
How worried should I be? Biggest fear is not seeing my 6 year old grow up.

You might try dropping your carb intake a bit to see if you can nudge your numbers closer to ideal. Some Type 2's go full keto, and some of us are more accurately described as low-carb.

3 years ago I was hospitalized with DKA and pancreatitis. My A1c was 14. My triglycerides were over 4000. I was discharged with handouts from the American Diabetes Association and a referral to a dietitian. 

Within 6 months, my A1c was at 10. And it stayed there. My triglycerides stayed above 1000. 

Over the past year and a half, Iâ€™ve gone from an A1c of 10 on the diet recommended by the American Diabetes Association, as administered by a dietician, to an A1c of 5.9 on a keto diet. 

I used to use 200 or more units of insulin a day. 100 basal, and another 100-120 short acting. 

I now use 20 units of basal insulin. And maybe 2 units of short acting to correct a mild high (above 130.) 

Most of the time my blood glucose is between 80-120. 

And Iâ€™m off meds for high triglycerides. Theyâ€™re under 200.

But if youâ€™re legit above 200, at &lt;20g of net carbs a day, not relying on resistant starches (like in commercial keto bread or Carb Balance tortillas,) not eating a lot of maltose or other sugar substitutes that you may be metabolizing... then youâ€™ve checked yourself for every reasonable reason to be that elevated. 

Talk with your doctor about increasing your insulin until you can get in for some testing. You really do need to make sure you havenâ€™t got something else going on.

T1 folks make little to none endogenous insulin. They may or may not have metabolic disorder/ insulin resistance. Regardless, they have no way to make their own insulin. 

Itâ€™s also possible for T2 folks to have this auto-immune disease triggered, and to lose their insulin-secreting cells. When that happens, they need a different strategy for insulin management. Ideally, someone diagnosed as both T1 and T2 would be under the care of an endocrinologist.

fm3pwud,Petra_Ann,2020-04-01 2:15,"As others said, please please please ask for cpeptide and the 5 antibody testing.

I'm STILL dx'd as T2 because I'm not showing antibodies but over the past 1.5 years my cpep has gone down.  When I was diagnosed, my fasting was 18.9 (340) and my a1c was 114 (12.6).  At the time of diagnosis I had been on the keto diet for almost 9 years already (I was doing it for another condition I have but since everyone on dad's side of the family is diagnosed with diabetes in their late 20s, early 30s I decided I'd kill 2 birds).  In addition, I had all the classic signs of diabetes.  No amount of water could quench my thirst, peeing every 10 minutes, dry mouth from hell, losing fistfuls of weight (over 11 kilo in 2 months and not trying) and a yeast infection that just would not go away.

Because I was diagnosed at 40 and am ""overweight"" (I have a condition called lipedema, the fat on my body is only going to come off with liposuction, removing it surgically or ironically diabetic ketoacidosis which is actually why I was on keto since ketosis seems to combat this fat for people at various levels) I was immediately diagnosed as T2.  I was put on metformin, told not to eat bread or drink juice, exercise and sent on my way.

Well, I was already keto, already lifted weights 4-6x a week and did quite a bit of cardio in the form of hiking, cycling and kayaking so I really didn't have much I could improve on in the diet or exercise areas.  So I trucked on and lasted on metformin for 2 weeks.  It made me slow, stupid, weak and I shit my pants at a conference half a world away.  It also did jack for my blood sugar and it's interesting to note that since I was testing, I noticed huge spikes in my blood sugar when I worked out.  I learned they're expected for weight lifting but not so much with cardio... mine went up an stayed there most of the day regardless of exercise type.

I was sent on to the diabetes clinic at the hospital and assigned an internist.  A friend around this point mentioned that adults could get T1 and I should have myself tested.  Everyone was adamant I wasn't T1 but did the tests which came back no antibodies (10% of T1D's never show positive for any antibody) and my cpeptide was normal and not high which would signal T2.  So I was put on various T2 meds, combos of T2 meds with varying doses and nothing worked and I just kept feeling sick.  Finally I put my foot down and told them to put me on insulin and only insulin. 

At first I was only put on basal and i had to go up to obscene amounts to get my bg to drop 1 point (was still eating keto at this point).  For some reason around this time I got really pissed at my diabetic nurse who was harping on me for not eating enough carbs (was about 30g) and decided to go with the ""moderate carb"" guidelines for the country so I upped myself to between 120-150g.  Boom.  My bg dropped from 15-18 to in range, 6-7 (once I adjusted my basal down not to hypo all the time).  It was like insulin resistance just disappeared.  However, I was having nasty postprandial spikes so I demanded fast acting as well.

I figured out that if I stay between 70-120g of carbs, I can keep my bg in range pretty easily.  If I go into ketosis (I can at 60g or less) I start getting resistant and my insulin needs go up and up.  If I eat more than 120 then all the things that I switched to keto for start coming back full force.  So 60-120 is my sweet spot.

Oh, and my insulin needs are really nothing.  On average, my TDD (total daily dose) is about 30u if I'm eating on the low end of my carb range and exercising daily.  Even if I'm eating at my high range I only need about 50ish units.  This always shocks my diabetic nurse because ""you're type 2 and type 2's take LOTS of insulin!"".  At this point I've stopped fighting since I have the treatment I want and that makes me feel the best.  The ONLY thing I'm not allowed to have is a dexcom (but I can have the freestyle) or a medtronic 670g because you have to take the senors with it and ""that's not available to T2's"".  Whatever.... hah. 

One more thing.. I have tried to go back to keto several times.  Especially after I got my pump since I thought that might control things better.  Nope, after about 6 days my bg starts going up and I've yet to find a basal rate that keeps it in normal.  I think I gave up when I hit about 80u basal and god knows how much for correction.

TL;dr Go get the tests to make sure you're not a misdiagnosed T1.

fm4mc9a,The_Little_Farmer,2020-04-01 8:59,"I agree with the others that you should get your C-Peptide and Type 1 antibodies checked. I will also convey with you some information I've learned regarding ketogenic diet and diabetes. So for sure I'm really simplifying this because I don't have a degree in health or nutrition, but I wanted to share this with you.

Based on what I've learned, in the short term the ketogenic diet does appear to help manage blood sugars and contribute to weight loss. However, once weight loss stops the ketogenic diet will lead to unstable blood sugars and big fluctuations because of insulin resistance. 

Carbohydrates are needed for energy. It is what your body burns for fuel. Fats are used to store energy, insulate organs, and absorb certain vitamins. Proteins are needed for making enzymes and hormones, as well as to build and repair cells. The majority of our diet is supposed to be carbohydrates. In eating ketogenic your body now has to derive energy from fats and proteins. Now fats and proteins are not being used to do the jobs they're supposed to be doing. 

So when they're being used by the body for energy, for some reason the signalling molecule that let's the liver know to stop dumping sugar into the blood is not present. So the liver continuously dumps sugar into your blood stream regardless of whether you need more. It is common over time for diabetics to become insulin resistant on a ketogenic diet and for the results you're seeing to occur. But a really good podcast that explains the science behind this is The Plant Proof Podcast with Simon Hill episode 74, where the host interviews a PhD in insulin biochemistry and someone with their Masters in Public Health. 

I would recommend adopting a plant-based diet to help with this. But don't straight up switch. You should slowly add more carbs into your diet as your body is extremely insulin resistant right now. But once you switch you'll need way less insulin. I can eat 420 g of carb a day and only need 35 units of fast acting and 4 units long acting. (I have type 1 diabetes.)

I think you really care about taking care of yourself. And what you're going through is really frustrating and hard. I support you in your journey no matter what. I just wanted to offer up some information that perhaps you hadn't seen before as an option. But don't take my word for it. Look at the research out there.

So it's no wonder people struggle with diabetes management. There's a lot of science behind diabetes and how eating a diet with saturated fats and animal products can directly cause insulin resistance.

ftznr5,TheWolfAndRaven,2020-04-02 19:12,"Hey all, recently found out I was diabetic with an a1c of ~11. Met with an Endocrinologist today, who gave me a meter and put me on metformin, but didn't really give me any guidance regarding what my numbers should be doing (I didn't think to ask). 

First test reading was 210 about 2 1/2 hours post meal (sandwich with low carb bread - about 14g of carbs total). I've been eating very low carb (averaging around 50g total for the whole day) for the last 10ish days - pretty much since my primary care called to confirm it. Haven't done much exercise since I've been recovering from surgery still, but was quite active before the surgery - I was just eating like shit and diabetes is hereditary. 

I believe when my blood was drawn for the surgery pre-op it tested at 270, so 210 is certainly an improvement. I just don't know what 210 means other than my meter telling me its ""above range"". Will it continue to go down as I continue to eat better and lose weight or is it too soon to tell based off just one reading?

fma0xjb,TeaAndCrackers,2020-04-02 19:32,"Your readings will bounce up and down quite a bit--one reading means nothing. Eventually you'll get your blood sugar readings where you want them by controlling your carb intake. Exercise helps, and medication helps as well.

It helps to eat to your meter...test your blood sugar before you eat something, then test again 1-1/2 hours later to see how high that particular food raised your blood sugar. If it raised it too high (my own personal limit is no more than 20-25 points), then don't eat that food again. That's how you learn what you should and shouldn't eat.

Decide what A1c you are aiming for, then eat to your meter, keeping your blood sugars in range for that particular A1c.  There are charts online where you can see what your blood sugar range should be to reach your A1c goal.

I eat no more than 50 carbs per day to keep my A1c in the 5s, watching my blood sugar to stay in that range.",Topic 7,20-Apr,noncovid,/r/diabetes/comments/ftznr5/new_to_all_this_did_my_first_glucose_test_today/fma0xjb/,0

fmdio13,TheWolfAndRaven,2020-04-03 19:53,"Thanks for that post. I've been trying to keep my carbs per meal under about 20, though sometimes I'm as high as 40 or so. My dad who is a type 2 gave me a short briefing on ""carb choices"" basically that every 15 grams of ""net carbs"" counts as one and 2-3 per meal was the guideline. Of course he's a bit older than me, so our numbers may be different. I've been trying to stick with that basic guideline as a jumping off point though. 

My biggest question right now is, will these numbers go down over time? Or does an ""out of range"" number now mean I should reconsider what I've already been eating?

To give an idea, here's yesterday's meals:

Breakfast - 2 Spoonfuls of Peanut Butter - 6g carbs. 

Lunch - 2 Lg Eggs, 1.5 Cup of ground turkey, Salsa + 1 cup of diced pears - 22g carbs. 

Dinner - Turkey Sandwich, low carb bread, light garlic mayo spread, ~ 13g carbs. 

2.5 hour post dinner Glucose was 210, Fasting glucose (13 hour post meal) this morning was 184. 

I know I'm eating at a calorie deficit, as a 6'5 250lb dude in his early 30s. The weight is pretty much just falling off right now despite my lack of activity (down about 10lbs in the last month). About 2 weeks before being diagnosed I was doing Intermittent fasting, so I've kinda shook those minor hunger pangs and now I only eat when I'm genuinely hungry. I will say though, I do have some serious carb cravings, and being on limited activity and social distancing isn't helping that.

fuk2ay,eggrollinmypants,2020-04-03 17:37,"Hello everyone.

Trying to find out if someone here has similar symptoms. Late September early October 2019. At the time I was pushing 190 lbs. I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. I had an A1C of 13.4 I was out on metformin and insulin. Around December I had a bout of what they called starvation Ketoacidosis. I was in the ER for 4 days while they tested and stabilized some numbers. I saw a Gastroenterologist who wanted me to get checked for gastroparesis. An Endo saw me as well. He ordered your typical panels to test for type 1. All came back negative. I was released. I left the hosptial and was put on a bolus insulin and ordered to see an endo. The endo at the hospital sent a referral to test for MODY diabetes, but the endo I went to see had a suspicion it was lada. Fast forward to January. Another episode about a month later. High ketones in the urine, again the called it starvation Ketoacidosis. Again in February I went back in, and I had another episode in early March. All the same symptoms vomiting nausea can't keep anything down, and the highest my blood sugars got was 220 in the hospital. The typical treatment is IV bags and other anti nausea meds that are given via IV. I went and saw the Top specialist at a Univeristy hospital. Tested my A1C it was down to 5.9. He wanted to pull me off insulin, but my morning numbers were somewhat out of whack. I have gone from originally 6 units of baslagar to 27 units now. I was doing a keto diet but all the Endos I have seen told me to stop and keep eating what I can. My weight at last check was 155, and I'm having a hard time. So here we are in early April, and I'm having symptoms like I did. I have been vomiting for 2 days my BS will not get below 140, even with no food. I'm starting to think I have a autoimmune disease along with having type 1.5. Lastly.

fmhdx9g,4thshift,2020-04-05 1:42,"&gt; due to the fact you are Korean.

Haha â€” Sorry, just too stupid.

Thereâ€™s 5 different autoimmune antibody tests that they can run. The most common is GAD-65.

It is possible you are not autoimmune. Though some people claim to be â€œType 1â€ even though they say they have no antibody positives. 

Diagnosis can be difficult for some people. Thereâ€™s several different types of MODY. Thereâ€™s also a version of Type 2 called Ketosis Prone Diabetes (KPD). If they never find the answer they might call it â€œidiopathic Type 1.â€ 

But what you are writing is a little confusing. â€œStarvation ketonesâ€ â€” are you starving yourself and/or not taking enough insulin? You say you are on keto diet, so likely having some ketones from that but it shouldnâ€™t send you into DKA unless you have insufficient insulin. But you are or are not taking 27 units and eating adequate food? You seem to say you lost 40 lbs. Again, seems unusual if you are taking insulin and eating enough balance of food.

The other test would probably be for C-peptide to see if you are producing an adequate amount of your own insulin.

&gt; Patients with diabetes who present with an acute illness, such as upper respiratory symptoms, pharyngitis, diarrhea, nausea, or allergic rhinitis, may seek care at various primary care offices and retail clinics. During an acute illness, blood glucose tends to rise due to the bodyâ€™s natural response to produce extra hormones to help fight off infections. The increase in hormones, although effective in fighting infections, can inhibit insulin binding, causing an increase in blood glucose. As a result, complications can arise during an acute illness that may result in more serious conditions if not addressed. Complications include, but are not limited to, hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, dehydration, DKA, and HHS.

A fasting glucose on 140 and 160 isn't the best, but if his levels are fairly stable throughout the day (when he wakes, before/after meals and before bed are common times to check glucose) then his control can be deemed relatively decent.

A1C is an 'average' of 2-3 months of blood glucose. Just like how a fasting value by itself doesn't determine good control, neither does A1C by itself mean much. If you dad has an A1C of 6.9% but his glucose doesn't swing up or down from those numbers much, then I'd argue he's better controlled than someone with an A1C of 6.9% who experiences bad lows and bad highs.

There is your answer.

Your body has become used to unhealthy blood glucose levels and resists change. You need to take control of your blood glucose. There will be a period of discomfort during the transition period but the eventual results and reduction of risk of complications will be worth it.

I know I was overeating from stress but I wasnâ€™t really sure how I gained that muchâ€” Iâ€™ve never been as heavy as I am. 

Something I noticed was that towards the end of my weight gain (it just stopped at a certain point I guess) was that if I had anything sweet like iced tea or a dessert I would constantly have to pee and the urge would come on quite suddenly. 

I avoided anything sugary for a few months and the problem went away. I eventually started having more sugar here and there and I started leaking a  tiny amount of urine throughout the day if I ate or drank something  really sweet. 

I manage this problem by avoiding it for the most part but if I really want something I donâ€™t really mind dealing with it.

People have varying levels of severity of side effects and the symptoms you're having are very common, but also avoidable for most people if you start with low doses and increase slowly. I would give your Dr a call and see if they are okay with you moving down to a smaller dose - if you use to have a lower dose that you tolerated better, I would go back to the highest dose you tolerated. People who are more sensitive usually start Metformin at 500mg 1x per day for about a week, then step up to 500mg 2x per day (morning &amp; evening) for another week, then maybe 1000mg in morning + 500mg evening for another week, and eventually to a max dose of 1000mg morning + 1000mg evening. You should not be getting more than 2000mg per day. As some people have mentioned, some people have to resort to an extended release formula, but insurances rarely cover the cost of that medication unless your Dr has already tried starting you on lower doses of Metformin. Once again, I would call your dr to see what they recommend. I'm sure they'd prefer you being on a tolerable dose of Metformin even if it's lower than their eventual target dose than.

I couldn't afford my insulin the past 6 months, so I've only been taking metformin (1000mg twice a day) and trying to eat well/exercise. I also have PCOS, so even though I made some changes (like never having sugar) and walking more, I didn't lose any weight (I didn't gain any either).

Well, thanks to covid19, my depression kicked in and I stopped eating as well and exercising. I didn't fall completely off the wagon, but I started having a few sugary snacks each day. Here is the crazy thing, since I stated my numbers have dropped about 59 points. Instead of being around 180 before a meal, I'm around 125, and my blood sugar is only rising about 25 points after eating.

fwxbrv,DocToothache,2020-04-07 18:42,"I am a 30 YO guy who is recently diagnosed with T2 diabetes. I've been overweight most of my life so I've been monitoring my blood glucose and I knew I was prediabetic starting 3\~4 years ago. I was on keto diet for couple months at a time, on and off, as I was trying to reduce my insulin resistance but since December last year, I had some other issue personal issue that made me gain 20 lb or so since November and now I am finally diagnosed with T2 as my A1c was 7.2 and fasting glucose was in 140s. 

My physician prescribed 500 mg Metformin twice a day with a meal but it doesn't seem like it's working. I'm 3 weeks into taking it and I don't regularly check my blood glucose but I check every other day, 4\~5 after a meal and it doesn't seem like my blood glucose goes down. I've randomly checked my blood glucose several dozen times in the past  3 weeks and it was never below 100 except once. 

Just last month, when I wasn't taking Metformin, my fasting was in the average of 140\~150 and close to 200 after a meal (and stay up there 180\~190) for several hours. The reason why I went to see my doctor was that I saw a significant delay in blood glucose reduction; I'd have a meal at like 3 PM and check my glucose level at like 10 PM and it'd still be like 170 to 180ish and in the morning, it'd be like 140. So I got scared and went to see my doctor.

My primary concerns are, it seems like Metformin isn't effective even at double dosage (I've tried like 3 times by doubling up my dosage) AND my diabetes seems to be progressing fast. I just checked my blood glucose 3 hours after a meal and it was in 220 (which I've never seen previously).

I was diagnosed t2 5 years ago.  I changed my diet, lost 50 lbs., exercised, etc.  Because my bg dropped, I got comfortable and began checking it less.

2) Keep notes regarding what you eat, stress levels, sleep disruptions, illness, exercise. These things will all impact your blood sugar.

3) Look into low-carb or keto diets. I personally find that low-carb, rather than full keto, is a little easier to maintain as a permanent lifestyle (and it's ADA recommended and therefore ok by my doctor, which saves me a little grief) but keto works well for a lot of people, too. /r/keto and /r/ketorecipes can help you get started.

For what it's worth, here's my story: At diagnosis my A1C was 6.9, then went up to 7.9 within a year. After a year of being on 2000mg Metformin and 5mg Glipizide my A1C was back down to 6.9. It wasn't until I went low-carb (high fat) that I was able to get a little control over my blood sugar and my eating. My A1C was a 6.2 after 3 months of low-carb, and I've since been able to drop the Glipizide while still seeing typical readings between 100 and 115. I expect it will further improve as I continue to lose weight; I'm down 45 lbs with another 115 or so to go. I use blood sugar logs with notes like the ones I described above to identify patterns. (I like to use a database in AirTable.) For example, today I confirmed that my blood sugar goes up when I exercise. 89 in the morning, 103 before noon exercise, 120 after exercise. Previously I identified that my worst blood sugar is always first thing in the morning (probably because I tend to binge in the evening). I used that information to make the decision to change the time of day I took my Glipizide (back when I was taking it) from in the morning to at night, and then used the data to confirm the change improved my average morning numbers without hurting the others.",Topic 7,20-Apr,noncovid,/r/diabetes/comments/fwxbrv/recently_diagnosed_metformin_doesnt_seem_to_be/fmrl43z/,0

Metformin is only an aid to an appropriate diet for blood glucose management. It cannot correct a high carb diet.

I was able to manage it since diagnosis and dropped from a 10+ HbA1c to a 5.1 with just metformin.

I went from 175lbs to 135lbs too (5""10 in height) so I thought I was doing great.  
The corticosteroids, which I only did for about 1.5 weeks, made me hit my first 300+ mg/dL. Doctor got me off the steroids onto a different immunosuppressant but my numbers never became the ""normal"" I had before.

Not even 2 weeks with steroids and my A1c went from 5.1 to a 5.7! I can shiver at what 3 months would be.

Went to my first endo over month ago and we just can't figure me out. Doctor had me on a 1:3 insulin to carb ratio and I still hovered 250+, then 1:2, then 1:1, then I decided to do 1:1 plus metformin (out of desperation) and still getting high numbers. 

I ate a usual meal I have for lunch that's around 10g carbs and did 20 units (2:1) with 500mg metformin and I finally went down to around 140mg/dL. But, with my control for almost a year now, anything above 110 was my standard of ""too high"" so now this change is insane to me...

I went through chemo and since I'm now immunosuppressed, its hard for me to see doctors during these times. May I ask anyone here for help and advice? I always had my self-control and discipline to tame diabetes but now I just can't without insulin, advice and help.

I've interacted with a 70 year old who was freshly diagnosed type 1. Age is not a factor by which you can diagnose any type of diabetes. C-peptides and antibodies are a must. As type 1 is an autoimmune condition, and autoimmune conditions are rarely standalone, the fact you were diagnosed with an autoimmune condition alongside diabetes heavily suggests your diabetes might be autoimmune in nature too.

The honeymoon phase is one where the body still produces some insulin. In adults this period can stretch a bit farther than in children, but ultimately autoimmune diabetes leads to insulin dependency.

&gt; I'm not aware of basal long acting insulin which sounds very familiar to the metformin extended release I used religiously before! If I think I got it correctly

Two entirely different things. Metformin helps prevent the body from releasing glucose from the liver and improves your sensitivity slightly, which is a handy tool for some diabetics to have. Basal insulin, also known as long-acting insulin for people who do manual injections, is the background insulin that is active between meals. The body releases small amounts of glucose throughout the day based on your needs and it needs small amounts of insulin to use that glucose. That's what basal or long-acting insulin does.",Topic 10,20-Apr,noncovid,/r/diabetes/comments/fxzq97/still_new_to_insulincarb_ratio_26m/fmytrzl/,0

fmz8rzx,seanbluestone,2020-04-10 2:28,"There's no reason to suggest nor assume dietary cholesterol has any negative affect on health outside of extreme circumstances where LDL are too high or HDL are too low. Chocolate (particularly dark chocolate) doesn't contain much cholesterol anyway and instead the concern would be saturated fat which a quick google tells me is around 8g/100g in pure cocoa. Saturated fat recommendations tend to cap out at around 30g/day so unless you're eating a ridiculous amount of dark chocolate (nearly impossible to do) or you're already eating a lot of fat that's not much of concern.

As for the overall and very general question of whether chocolate is good for you- it's probably fine in small quantities and a few studies show possible links to improvements in heart health for people already at risk (though no benefit in healthy individuals). It contains some less common nutrients like iron, copper, magnesium and zinc, and it's particularly high in flavonols so that makes sense.

In short, it's likely good as part of a balanced diet or if you're not eating enough of the nutrients present in dark chocolate.

I wanted to solicit some opinions from more experienced redditors on the topic of requesting insulin from my doctor. 

Now that I know more about blood glucose regulation, insulin resistance and diabetes. I believe I have been insulin resistance since my teen years. I gained a lot of weight pre-puberty, my parents tried to get my to lose weight by strictly restricting my diet. I remember extreme thirst and extreme hunger during this time. In my young adult years, I gained a ton of weight on moving to america - diet after diet failed and the only diet that seems to help me lose weight is a low cab diet. 

Second - I know my diet is not the best for an insulin resistant person, it is a classic indian vegetarian diet - high on carbs, low in protein and fat. I have never eaten meat and my attempts to start eating meat as part of a keto diet have not worked (tried several years) at the same time I don't have any obvious high carb foods to cut out of my diet - i don't eat dessert more than once a month, and don't consume alcohol more than once or twice a month. I can shift my diet to lower carbs by reducing wheat and sharply reducing rice but i don't think i can sustainably turn in to a life long low carb eater. 

I'm 35 - I hope to be around for my infant son and live another 40 years or more. My thoughts have been turning towards requesting insulin because 

1) I've already been insulin resistant for a long time &amp;

2) I don't have a lot great levers to pull diet wise to bring my insulin resistance down

I figure what is the point of waiting another 5-10 years to go on insulin, all the while my natural blood sugar control keeps deteriorating and i am exposed to the high sugars. 

Any insight or advice is much appreciated. I'm willing to hear that I am just panicking if that is what it is.

That is commendable but if you eat a high carb diet it sort of cancels that out if that makes sense. I don't know what you mean by high carb diet as that number can differ for everyone, but it may be best to talk to your doctor about your questions. They will know what may work for you. If you cannot control your bg especially fasting levels, morning levels or if 2 hours after eating they stay high, and diet and exercise do not help, then you need to find what works best for you.

""I can shift my diet to lower carbs by reducing wheat and sharply reducing rice "" If these badly infuence your bg levels then I would stop eating those. Or in tiny amounts. There are also replacements for wheat and rice, such as almond flour (for wheat products)  konjac flour instead of rice. I do some curries with konjac rice and my favourite is kashmir spinach paneer etc, lots of vegetarian choices if you cannot eat meat. It just takes some extra planning and cooking time sometimes.

TLDR: what does your meter say? If you are always high you will end up with complications.

Keto is not the only option out there, and if OP says it's not working out for them, then suggesting the very thing they say doesn't work is extremely unhelpful.

Furthermore, a type 2 diabetic doesn't get their beta cells destroyed by taking exogenous insulin, that is absolute horsecrap and not supported by any biological science. The body can naturally produce less insulin if exogenous insulin is present, because the body works on a demand basis, and if less insulin is demanded of it because exogenous insulin is present, it's going to produce less. This actually helps prolong beta cells' lives. You know what destroys the beta cells? Persistent and prolonged insulin overproduction. It's the most common reason type 2 diabetics who have had uncontrolled diabetes for a long time end up insulin dependent.

fysgrw,DeathChill,2020-04-10 17:16,"So I was recently diagnosed with diabetes just as this COVID-19 thing started causing issues. Great timing. 

I had been waking up every hour or two to pee for a few weeks, but I was incredibly thirsty. The final straw that pushed me to go to the doctors was being so tired at work (construction) that I could have laid down and slept anywhere without an issue. 

So I went in, they said there was sugar in my urine and they tested my blood and it came in at 28mmol/L (504 mg/dL). They sent me to the hospital where they lowered my blood sugar via time and then a shot of insulin. The hospital kicked me out with a prescription of Metformin (500mg 2x a day) and an appointment to talk with a dietitian a couple of weeks later. 

Talked with the dietitian over the phone; turns out I was already eating everything I should. Love plain Greek yogurt with some frozen blueberries, love oatmeal, eat chicken for lunch every single day. Figured I was in a good spot. 

Well, my blood sugar didn't really seem to stabilize and an internal medicine doctor talked with me (again, over the phone) and increased my Metformin to 1000mg 2x a day and added Trajenta 5mg + Linagliptin 5mg 1x a day. Been on that for about two weeks. Blood sugar still is all over the place. 

What are the chances that I'm not a type 2 diabetic? No doctor/dietitian that I've talked to since being diagnosed has actually seen what I look like and it seems like they're all operating under the assumption that I'm overweight. Problem is that I have an overweight BMI, but it's due to muscle. 

The only days my blood sugar dips into normal range is after work. I do rebar, which is very physical so I am exercising all day. The gyms being closed have really screwed me, but work days are probably okay for at least moderate exercise.

""High"" ketone reading means you don't have enough circulating glucose being used for energy. And if you say you have ""food addiction"" which sounds like you eat carbs, then, this is quite possibly an insulin shortage problem. 

418 glucose is very high, as well. You are probably becoming very dehydrated, and may be having acidosis -- which, along with high glucose kind of doubles the body's effort to pee a lot of these excessive molecules out of your system. Also, your electrolytes may be getting out of balance, and that can result in a lot of bad stuff.

g5p2af,Dizzy-Anybody,2020-04-21 15:20,"  Hi all,

New to this sub reddit. 

My brother (turning 34 this year) currently has type 2 diabetes. He had been diagnosed with T2 about 5-6 years ago and takes medications every day. On top of his diabetes medication, he also takes supplemental vitamins along with lithium (has psychological issues). Families from both sides has strong history of diabetes. For instance, all uncles from my momâ€™s side has diabetes and my grandma from dadâ€™s side died of diabetes.

So with this COVID pandemic my brother has been eating delivery/ fast foods almost 1-2 meals every day (for instance, pad thai takeout for 4-5 times a week, subway subs, fried pork, fried chicken, lot of rice, waffles, hamburgers for about 3-4 times a week combined with occasional chocolates/ whipped cream cakes etc.). He's also been drinking 1-2 cans of diet or zero Coke 6 days out of a week. He eats until he feels full and does not use portion control boxes or any other visible method of portion control. On top of his various medications, he also exercises, which include walking for about 1-2 hours every day (or sometimes even longer). Thereâ€™s no intense running/weight lifting or any muscle exercise. 

I've told him that he needs to stop his eating habits or else he'll end up in a life support in a hospital soon but he argues back that because he does all things I mentioned above, (for example, diabetes medication, exercise for long hours and diet/zero Coke has no sugar and hamburgers are fine as long as there are no potato fries) heâ€™s and will be completely ok and healthy. On the other hand, he says I am being too cynical and nagging.

Your son does not produce insulin so they can not do this. His cells arenâ€™t overwhelmed with sugar. They are desperate for sugar because he is a growing baby and needs energy from sugar.

You have a different fundamental problem than someone with t2. Whoever told you to keep him at 15g of carbs is conflating t1 with t2. 

Give him all you would normally give any baby. Let him breastfeed till he is satisfied and provide him enough insulin to allow his cells to absorb the glucose in his bloodstream. 

A type 1 can eat any amount of sugar and as long as they dose enough insulin their blood glucose wonâ€™t rise (and neither will their a1c). They can still get fat from what they eat but that is a separate problem. Babies are supposed to be fat.

  Pretty much your life is gonna change dramatically. Donâ€™t be scared of not being able to eat just start making note of whatâ€™s the worst things to eat and try to cut down on them. 
 A good thing is if ur like me you already loved meat and cheese so things like string cheese and salami are a go to snack just not to many ritz crackers. Cheese cake isnâ€™t to bad for dessert but not to much of anything is gonna be the way to go. Beef jerky, pork rinds, baby carrots, peanut butter, and diet sodas all good so try to get full off of them (easier sad the done).  Stay away from things that seem good like Jamba Juice or any kinda juices they have hella carbs. You can find some diet juice that tastes about the as the normal stuff but not as much flavor variety. If your having trouble like I do because you live in America and the government can care less about our health by making sure almost everything is high in carbs so companies like Nabisco and Hostess can make billions on kids under 10 getting the disease. You can ask your doctor for a insulin that will counter the carbs before you indulge in a bad meal. I take one called Humalog and Iâ€™m able to hit up Mcee Dees with out my sugar levels going crazy. Just have to check my blood before then anticipate what Iâ€™m gonna eat and do some simple math to take the medication.

gacjhr,theBuddhaInMe,2020-04-29 9:25,"Have a family history of diabetes, both parents got YE in their mid 30s.

I have been trying to avoid it for this long but it can with a BANG at age 45. 

A1C was 14.7 (!!) . Last yearly checkup it was 6.7. So it detoriated this quick in a year. The doctor looked at my diet and lifestyle and couldn't really find anything, as in cut this thing out immediately. 

All this happened first week of March this year. So she started metformin right away with 2am 2pm 500mg dosage and asked me to lay off of alcohol.

This whole thing has hit me really hard mentally and am still trying to get my head around it. I knew I was prone to it but being diagnosed and put on medication hit me hard.

I bought the generic glucose meter and am measuring around 140-150 in the morning before breakfast and 110-120 in the evening before dinner.

Questions:
1. What do the numbers above translate in terms on A1C? My next checkup is in first week of June. I just want to be mentally prepared and not be hit with it. Honestly, I have given up pretty much all food and alcohol...Eat bare min healthy stuff and don't know what more can I do.

2. What is the relationship of alcohol and diabetes? Wife says that's the reason my numbers detoriated this quick. I don't want to believe it but am open to real life experience from others. And no I'm not talking drunk, just 1-2 drinks in the evening to wind down..

3. I have asked my doctor to prescribe me a CGM. any advice on which one to get and what to keep in Mind when using it would be appreciated.

I have more questions but will stop for now. Still trying to come to terms, it's been over a month and i don't think my mind has still accepted this. 

Also ordered Dr Neel Bernard's book from Amazon in hopes that something would come out of it. Basically grasping at straws here... Anything that would help.

Understandable, getting diagnosed is tough, but I think you should give yourself a break, in all the research I have read genes play a large factor.  Lifestyle certainly can make things worse, but if all it took was lifestyle most of the US would be Type 2.

If you have any of the antibodies your diagnosis and treatment will change quite a bit.  This is common in adults because the onset of Type 1 is slower in adults so many don't go through the DKA that kids and young adults do before getting diagnosed.

fozsmow,4thshift,2020-04-29 14:35,"14.7% is very high for a sustained glucose. (A1c is a 3-month average.) We couldnâ€™t tell you if you are Type 2 insulin resistant, or autoimmune with beta cell loss, or some other reason. Nor could we say your parents are this or that. Further tests might eliminate the possibility of autoimmunity â€” Being antibody positive very well could explain a sharp rise In a year. C-peptide test might indicate if you have too low or high insulin output. Maybe you were dehydrated most of the time, which would also concentrate glucose readings.

But suppose you are Type 2 insulin resistant. Your belief then would be to reduce the resistance, if possible, with less or no drugs. 

Dr. Barnard is going to tell you saturated fat is the problem â€” eat fruit and vegetables with very little fat, and as raw as possible; no processed junk. Animal products are the problem of modern diabetes epidemic.

Dr. Bernstein is going to tell you to Eat more protein, almost no carbs except for no starch vegetables, and fat is not much of a consequence (except keto diet is not the best idea). Avoid all sugars and no processed junk. Use just enough medication properly, and you will be at normal with daily maintenance with a low-carb diet. You are diabetic; high carb diets are the problem.

Dr. Hallberg is going to say, â€œFat is healthy. Eat a low-carb and ketogenic diet to lose weight and drop insulin needs. Stop eating processed foods. Eat lots of natural fats including saturated fat from meats and coconuts, nuts, avocados; eat moderate protein though, and even less carbs and only from non starchy veg.

Dr. Lustig is going to tell you that processed food is the problem. Sugar and fructose are the enemies of the human metabolic pathways, because fructose is processed to become fat, which is stored in the liver. This causes non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. That causes all kinds of hormonal disruptions, and the visceral fat is the problem of metabolic syndrome. The problem isnâ€™t flab but rather of inner organs becoming clogged with fats from high fructose, and secondarily by high carb intake. Quit eating sugar and drinking fruit juice. Junk food is scientifically designed to be addictive, and marketing campaigns are false and evil.

Dr. Fung is going to tell you that people do have this problem with NAFLD, and that reducing carbs is also very effective; but the main solution is to do intermittent fasting. That way you can get enough nutrition but also reduce intake of energy enough that you can remove the fat from the liver. Diabetes is a disease of Insulin resistance due to excess energy, and it being stored in the wrong places. Remove the excess and your body will repair itself, and you will also get the benefit of autophagy (metabolic recycling). Junk food makes people eat all day long and this raises insulin levels all day long. This is the problem of insulin resistance â€” constantly causinG the body to Produce insulin all day, to accept energy it doesnâ€™t need.

Dr. Moore will say that the solution is a very low calorie diet for 3 months. Again to starve the excess fat out of the liver and pancreas. Like 700 or 800 calories per day for 3 months.

American a Diabetes Association is basically: Eat a â€œbalanced dietâ€ that includes â€œhealthy carbsâ€ and 1/2 portions (Half a bagel, small cup of juice, small plate of pasta or rice). And meats that are low in fat. 

So, you see â€” lots of ideas. You have to pick one that sounds good â€” they all have books that are convincing. They are considered kooks and cults and unsustainable and unnecessary by some portion of the community. 

As far as alcohol â€” you see that nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is a problem, so then logically alcoholic fatty liver disease is a problem as well. Alcohol can suspend release of glucose from the liver, but this is not a healthy solution. Metformin does a similar lowering of glucose from the liver, but also sensitized the cells to uptake insulin.


Use a glucometer to guide you. Get some physical activity â€” even pacing around the room and waving your arms while watching TV will lower glucose. Using muscles makes them more sensitive to taking up glucose. Stay hydrated. Try the meds â€” they wonâ€™t cure you of anything, but they help to control glucose.... And if none of it is working well, go get those antibody tests. No cure for Type 1; insulin then becomes the priority â€” diet and exercise still important, though.",Topic 10,20-Apr,noncovid,/r/diabetes/comments/gacjhr/new_to_diabeteskinda_mad_and_depressed/fozsmow/,0

fpcxaf3,sitryd,2020-05-03 7:11,"Well, if Iâ€™m reading this correctly, basically found that if postprandial glucose levels spiked above 180 in a T2D admitted with COVID they had an 11% mortality rate, versus if it stayed below 180 they had a 1.1% chance.  Expressly excludes T1D (too few in the sample) but unless thereâ€™s some other physiology at play it doesnâ€™t bode well for T1... rather difficult to avoid any spike above 180 during the day. If itâ€™s associated with good control (A1C) then perhaps a T1D tighter baseline control.

fpdnq3w,sitryd,2020-05-03 11:30,"Keeping my response to the article - it delineates the groups into those who didnâ€™t spike past 180 *while sick* and those that did.  Iâ€™ve had illnesses where, even without eating and using aggressive control, spiking last 180 was inevitable.  Fever can make insulin unpredictable.  And there are people with far more brittle conditions, or without the resources (mainly time) to avoid spiking. 

All of which is to say - if the â€œpoor controlâ€ group is defined as only those that spike past 180, many type 1 diabetics may not be able to do so despite best efforts if they get sick.  But if they T2 maximum of 180 for glucose variability is merely an indicator that their diabetes is almost entirely controlled (i.e. no spike occurred because medication ensured proper physiologic responses) then T1, generally, have a shot if they have a decent A1C.",Topic 5,20-May,covid,/r/diabetes/comments/gcokqn/important_new_research_glucose_control_has_a_big/fpdnq3w/,0
fpds41m,dv_,2020-05-03 12:11,"Good point. I myself actually mentioned some resources in the other post of mine here that explain why hyperglycemia impairs the immune system's function. It therefore makes sense that during infection, those with BGs above 180 have a worse outcome on average.

I think both characteristics - the immediate effect of acute hyperglycemia and the longer-term effects of chronic hyperglycemia - have an influence. Somebody whose BG is often high even when not sick is more likely to have a harder time during an infection. And, it will be more difficult for a T1 to avoid acute hyperglycemia and its immediate effects on the outcome of COVID-19.

The only conclusion I can draw from this is that maintaining good BG in daily life is again shown to be critically important, since then, even stubborn high BGs during the infection may not worsen the situation as much as in a person whose BG is chronically high.

Incidentally, I recall a guy who used his DIY loop during a high-dose Prednisone therapy to keep his BG in check. It was amazingly efficient - his HbA1c after 4 weeks of Prednisone was around 5.3% !!! But the DIY loop was administering truly scary amounts of insulin.

T1s are more likely to use CGM (allowing them to detect the high more quickly, and begin correcting while the sugar is on its way up but not actually high yet) and T1s are more likely to use treatment which quickly corrects a high sugar (insulin). 


Also, if a diabetic (of either type) has an HbA1c within the normal range and doesn't have extreme highs or lows, wouldn't their risk be similar to a nondiabetic? 180+ is not an extreme high - I mean more like the levels where you start checking for ketones.",Topic 7,20-May,covid,/r/diabetes/comments/gcokqn/important_new_research_glucose_control_has_a_big/fpe9wgh/,0

gflp0l,JunkyDunkyMunkey,2020-05-07 20:40,"In December, I started a pretty heavy workout routine and took my 6'1, 260lbs down to about 240 by January.

I was diagnosed as T2 towards the end of January.  Had gone in for the normal checkup, and random sampling was 205.  A1C was 10.3. 

Immediately was started on .25 Ozempic, which after a month was supposed to go to .5 after my followup appointment.  

During that first month, it was hell.  The whole experience freaked me out so bad, I ate basically no carbs.  I never ate much sugar before, but if it had added sugar, it was gone from my diet.  

Was almost on a starvation diet and I can't imagine I was eating much more than 1200-1500 calories, which for a big dude, isn't much.  I was also working out for 45 minutes to an hour every day.  My first big mistake was also here.  During this first month, I wasn't monitoring random sugars.

Fast forward I ended up being down to about 225lbs at my first followup appointment.  At this point, I had only been monitoring sugars for a few days, so the doctor told me to proceed with doubling my Ozempic dose.  My next dose was 6 days out so I proceeded to sample blood sugar religiously.

That whole week I never saw a random sugar number that would be considered high for a non-diabetic, and was having a few episodes of low numbers (&lt;70).  I called the doctor back, and confirmed to just leave the dose alone.

***

So here comes my need for advice.  For the last three months, I've been monitoring sugars religiously.  I've slowly been getting braver, eating pizza, Subway, and even a big Mac/french fries/and probably a damned half a cup of ketchup (my kryptonite).  Due to covid, my workouts have died off a bit, but the Ozempic is still suppressing my appetite.

Out of 300+ readings, the number of readings that a doctor would even bat an eye are less than maybe six readings.  I finally took a CVS A1C test today (which I appreciate may not be fully accurate), and it was 4.8%, which matches up from the random reading averages.  I go back to my doctor tomorrow and am not sure what to tell him. 

If I eat something low carbish, a few hours later I feel like hell.  If I eat carbs, I feel okay, but still short of like shit because of Ozempic side effects.

Other than filling him in all this information, I guess I'm just looking for advice.  My momz, who is a long time nurse, thinks it's just crazy that medication was the doctor's first response.  At the same time, obviously my A1C was pretty high.

Sorry that this got long, but I've honestly not talked to anybody about it.

tl;dr:

* 10.2 A1C in Jan
* Started on Ozempic.  Declined increasing the dose after 1 month.
* Took OTC A1C test 3 months later, 4.8%. Random blood samplings match this number.
* What should I tell/ask doctor tomorrow???",Topic 2,20-May,covid,/r/diabetes/comments/gflp0l/looking_for_advice_before_my_4_month_appointment/,Looking for advice before my 4 month appointment tomorrow.

fpvkgo3,ddoriguzzi,2020-05-08 7:03,"As far as what to tell the doctor: tell him/her exactly what you just told us. I love hearing about it when my patients put the kind of effort that you did into getting your diabetes under control. But I also like being there for them to coach them back when they start to stumble. Knowing the context helps me determine whether or not additional medication is actually necessary. Sounds like your glucose numbers are good, but if they werenâ€™t, I might be more inclined to coach you through the challenges than to simply add more medication.
Knowing the story may also help your doctor to know if the Ozempic is even necessary anymore. Youâ€™ve lost about 13.5% of your bodyweight and in clinical trials, improvements in diabetes typically happen after at least 5% weight reduction. The 0.25 mg dose of Ozempic isnâ€™t even considered a therapeutic dose. Itâ€™s an introductory dose to let your body get used to it enough to tolerate 0.5 mg dose. Canâ€™t give you medical advice over the Internet, but I can tell you that if you were my patient with an A1c of five-ish after losing that much weight, I would lose the Ozempic (Assuming itâ€™s the only diabetes medication youâ€™re taking). 
That being said, there are some cardiovascular benefits of [meds in that class](",Topic 8,20-May,noncovid,/r/diabetes/comments/gflp0l/looking_for_advice_before_my_4_month_appointment/fpvkgo3/,0
fpvub8t,sarahspins,2020-05-08 8:32,"&gt;What should I tell/ask doctor tomorrow???

You may as well just read off the post you just wrote - and maybe get out of this idea that you're doing something ""wrong"" if the numbers on your meter say you're doing okay, despite some sub-par dietary choices.   Diet is only PART of the picture.. your weight loss also has a big positive effect on your overall glucose control, as well as a million other things.

Despite your mom's assumptions, it sounds like you actually have a smart doctor - too many don't do ANYTHING for their T2 patients early on, and ultimately leave them uncontrolled for many months and even years until they've developed some sort of complication from their uncontrolled diabetes and better control becomes a must - most of these patients had no idea that things were so bad because their doctor downplays how real this disease is and doesn't offer them home glucose testing.  Be thankful that you weren't put in that position.   

If you want to consider going off the ozempic and maybe onto something else like Metformin, or even off meds entirely, you can just ask - remember your doctor works for you, and unless you're simply not getting the results they want, they're not really the one calling the shots.  If what you are doing is working (even if you don't fully know why) then you carry a bit of power in determining your course going forward - don't be afraid to advocate for yourself if you need to.",Topic 9,20-May,noncovid,/r/diabetes/comments/gflp0l/looking_for_advice_before_my_4_month_appointment/fpvub8t/,0

gnwdll,BanditSixActual,2020-05-21 5:58,"In February, I was told I was diabetic, type 2.  I'd like to say it blindsided me, but I'm a 50yo man who drank at least a half gallon of soda every day.  A1C was 11.  They were surprised by the lack of high blood pressure / bad cholesterol and said they weren't going to prescribe meds for that, which they usually do as a trifecta.  I just got metformin and a meter prescription with instructions to start out with testing in the morning before food and 2 hours after meals if I felt poor.  

I immediately cut out soda, and on the nutritionist's advice, dairy.  I got some valuable lessons about net carbs and have switched my bread intake to carb balance tortillas.  I got my bcg meter, a One Touch Ultra, and started testing before breakfast.  I had been without soda for 4-5 days by this point.  My blood sugar was 187.  I've been working hard, eating better, and using Huel Black Edition for my ""I don't have time to eat"" meals instead of a fast food meal.  I've kind of expanded that to 2+ meals a day just because it's so fast and easy.  I'm down 30lbs.  I ride my bike daily for 45m-2h.  Morning meter tests range from 97-120 depending on how late my supper was.

On Monday, May 18th, I got a follow up A1C test for an appointment next week.  I was kind of excited because I've worked really hard on this.  Yesterday, I got a call from the Doctor's receptionist who said, ""We got your results in, the doctor says your numbers are still high and she'd like you to work on reducing your sugar/carb intake.""

I had that moment of rage where you think everything you did was for nothing, and it's time to devour an entire cheesecake.  This morning, I found the uploaded test results and looked through it.  There was my A1C of 6.0.  

Wait, what?  My A1C dropped by 5 points in 3 months and that was the message I got?  I see improvement, solid improvement.  I'm going to call this a win.  Hopefully, I get more constructive feedback at my appointment.

I'm looking for resources and reading on this disorder as it relates to diabetes.  My limited Google skills turn up a bunch of info alt ADHD, and I'm not educated enough to know if it's the same thing or a close approximation.  One of my doctors suggested in an email yesterday that it would explain a lot of the general vacant-brained idiocy I've been guilty of in recent months.

He'll get into it further when I see him in a couple of weeks, I'm sure.  And I suspect he's plotting to test me for it now that it's on his radar.  He suggested reading up ahead of time and bringing questions, so if you're aware of anything academic or otherwise I'd love to see it.

There are also associations of ADHD as being related to Executive Function Deficit Disorder.

Once you add diabetes to ""Executive Function Deficit Disorder"" (with the quotes to prevent bad matches),  then you start getting references to diabetic ads on pages that discuss ADHD and Executive Function Deficit Disorder.   I am not seeing any OBVIOUS connection.

Based on the limited results (3 pages) and the fact that ads for diabetic recipes are on sites discussing Executive Function Deficit Disorder and ADHD, I don't think they are directly related.

Rather than light beer consider investigating your local brands of low-carb beer. This is my standard reply to your general question. 

Drink sensibly. My definition of sensibly is pretty simple: do not drink to excess.

As a diabetic excess is defined by two separate factors: effects on blood glucose and effects on my ability to act sensibly.

I never drink to the point of inebriation. Drunk diabetics make very poor decisions about carb intake and, if used, meds or insulin.

I did a lot of testing after different types of drinks, different amounts consumed, drinks with and without food etc etc. I suggest you do the same.

For myself I found a glass or two of dry red or white wines are fine with a meal provided the meal was low in carbs. I can enjoy neat spirits, or spirits with diet mixers, in moderation any time but too many will send me low or can cause odd timing of highs and lows if consumed with a meal. The same applies to Australian low-carb beers. I treat normal carb beers (8-15 gms carb per glass) and stouts as a snack between meals.

When ordering spirits do not trust post-mix mixed drinks. If you cannot add your own mixer from a diet can or bottle drink something else.

gpfxmx,JunkyDunkyMunkey,2020-05-23 17:24,"About this time in January, I was diagnosed T2, with 205 random blood sugar, and 10.2 a1c. Was immediately put on .25 Ozempic, and told to come back in a month.

I think I did what a lot of people do.  Exercised like a crazy person almost daily, cut out all carbs, and was probably not eating enough.  I also did some reading and started taking Berberine (1200-1500mg), Milk Thistle (3 normal ones), and alpha-linolenic acid (1200mg).

I did lose some weight, but definitely not as much as I thought I should.  As mentioned, I was sort of starving myself.

 My failure during this whole first month was doing zero monitoring.  During this time I was also having a number of blood pressure related episodes (low), so I was removed from my normal BP meds.

A few days before my followup appointment, I bought a meter and started testing like crazy.  Numbers were 100% normal. 70-90 in the morning, 110-130 at most between an hour and 2 hours post eating, dropping down to 95 or so three hours post prandial.  I discussed this with my doctor, and he just said to stay on the .25 dose of Ozempic and continue to monitor.  He said to come back in three months for A1C.

Of course COVID hits, and my exercise peters out.  I'm closely monitoring my numbers for the next few months, and never saw anything higher than 130 except for a handful of times, which I didn't have an explanation for at the time, but I think I do now. 

***

I slowly got braver, and reintroduced stuff into my diet.  

I was never a big sweets person, and never drank much but a diet soda here or there, but I was eating things like:

* Big Mac, Medium Fries, half a cup of ketchup or more
* Pizza, usually cauliflower crust, but sometimes thin crust, and every once in a while,  full blooded crust
* 12 inch whole wheat turkey subs from Subway.  This was more than a few times a week.

I largely tried to keep the carbs in check, like a lot of breakfasts I would just eat some eggs and avocado, but I also wasn't really trying too hard that last month or so, eating a lot of the stuff I mentioned.  Hell, I even had a handful of M&amp;M's from time to time.  Again, monitoring closely and never really saw anything even a non-diabetic would see as concerning.

So, A1C time hits a few weeks ago.  I do the home test, 4.8%.  I get the lab test done, 4.6%.  With the doctor, we make the decision to stay on the same level of Ozpemic.

Arriving at the moral of this story...

That was two weeks ago or so.  In the last week or so, my numbers have been kind of crazy for me.  Up around 140-150 after eating, and they would stay up above 110 consistently even 3-4 hours after eating. 

Even on days where I'd eat super carb-light, a few eggs for breakfast, whole-wheat carb balance torilla +  avocado + refried beans, chicken breast + carrots and cauliflower for dinner,  something I've eating 100 times over the last three months, my numbers would be very high for me.

Then I realized what it was, because of COVID, Amazon had taken longer to delivery my Berberine.  And because my schedule was:

* Berberine pre-breakfast
* Milk thistle post-breakfast
* ALA lunch time

It sort of broke my supplement cycle, and while I was out of berberine, I was hit/miss taking the other two.  

The berberine got here a few days ago, and after getting back on my daily regiment, I've changed NOTHING else other than taking my supplements.  My average numbers have returned back to 70-90 from 100-140.

Since making this revelation, I've look backed over all my food and supplement logs for the last 3+ months.

The days where I had an uncharacteristic spike in readings have been when I've missed supplements, particularly the berberine.  I'm not totally sold on the ALA, but the milk thistle seems to have a big impact too, particularly with the berberine. 

I am definitely not a doctor, but it might be worth asking your doctor about one or all of these if you are a T2.  And everybody responds differently.  But I'm now convinced these supplements are making all the difference in managing my glucose levels.",Topic 7,20-May,covid,/r/diabetes/comments/gpfxmx/my_4_month_t2_journey_with_supplements/,My 4 month T2 Journey with supplements

gw6wlz,Furyan9x,2020-06-03 17:57,"Hello again, r/diabetes! I'm here once again seeking advice from my peers. 

It's gonna get lengthy so I'll add a TL;DR for you lovely folks. 

I was diagnosed type 2 may of 2015 with a blood glucose of 659. I weighed 389 pounds and I drove cross country for a little over a year prior. After my diagnosis I spent 3 years in terror pretty much starving myself and, by starvation, dropped down to 215. My stomach and arm skin sagged, my face looked like a drug addicts face and I was not in a good spot.

 My HBA1C went from 13.5 to 6, and I felt some freedom to eat more things. During this 3 years I was unemployed, and spent all my time playing videogames, sulking, and frantically checking my blood sugar any time i felt a little bit off. 

So, I then began eating more foods, sought employment, and tried to cheer myself up about the situation. My spirits were lifted a little by being able to maneuver much easier at my new weight, after years of being obese and hyperventilating just getting out of bed.

 Now I'm working road maintenance, I'm at 280, my a1c is slowly climbing every 3 months, and ive gained about 40 pounds since October. The quarantine, my false sense of security and having money in my pocket have put me on a path back to 400 pounds and I am now freaking out.. again. 

Scouring the internet for information on where to start with a proper diet and starting to workout and it's just too much. As if type 2 diabetes is not enough, I also have Anhidrosis. I only sweat from my face and my armpits, the rest of my body just doesn't sweat. To counteract this I always use cooling towels at work and frequently pour water on myself when working in the heat. The guys at work laugh but it works. 

I'm in much better shape than I was at 389, no physical activity at all, and eating like a mad man. I get exercise at work pretty much daily, even though I know it's not enough to cover how poorly I've been eating lately. I've attempted to start workouts at home, push ups situps squats planking but I really lack the willpower to be consistent with it. I'm exhausted from work pretty much every day when I get home, and on my off days the last thing I feel like doing is exercising. I'm sore, I'm tired, I just wanna lay in bed and watch Netflix lol 

You'd think the threat of returning to obesity and future complications with my blood sugar would be incentive enough to exercise and eat better  but sadly for me it's not. I often berate myself while laying in bed when I could be walking, or when I buy something I know I shouldn't eat.. and the internal conflict this creates exhausts me further. I'm 27, 6'5'' at 280. I'm a big guy and I enjoy eating like.. a lot. I've made progress with my diet but it's still 40% good 60% bad. I don't even really know what I expect to gain from posting this, but anything will help cause I'm at a crossroads and I feel like if the decision is left to me entirely I will make the wrong choice as I have been since 2018. 

My doctor just scolds me and tells me to do better, informs me of all the shit that will happen if I stay on this path, and knowing this i still make bad choices.. not all the time but often enough that I'm worried about it. 

So yea that's about it.. any links to sites, fitness apps I could buy, books to read.. I'm willing to make a damn good attempt at getting my shit together cause I'm fed up with it all. I tossed all my bullshit snacks when I got off work today.. so that's a start right? 

Tl;Dr

Diagnosed type 2 2015 at 389 pounds.  Starved myself to 215. Got a job and a big head and started eating poorly again. From 215-280 since 2018, and feeling the effects of my poor diet more and more. Overwhelmed with trying to start down a better path, healthy eating habits and exercise are.. quite literally the bane of my existence. I also have Anhidrosis, which idek how it applies to my situation but it makes physical activity more of a chore for me than it already is. Looking for inspiration, advice, references to sites, apps, books, whatever you think will help me.

fthj0xq,aliasgrace13,2020-06-09 8:51,"Hey! First off, I know you're probably feeling a combination of fear, anger, helplessness, sadness, etc. about your diagnosis. I was diagnosed about a month ago myself, and I'm still processing everything. But the good news is it gets easier.

The most important thing you can do right now is try to find a glucose meter. You'll want to test your blood sugar to figure out what foods/activities affect you, and how. Start by checking in the morning, before meals, one and two hours after meals, and before bed. That way, you'll be able to see what foods cause your blood sugar to go up.

I want to ask why you're cutting fat out of your diet? For a lot of people with T2D (myself included, for what it's worth), fat is the macronutrient that has practically zero effect on blood sugar. For example, yams make me spike up to 180 mg/dl (10 mmol/l), but I can eat a giant plate of bacon, eggs, cheese, and avocado and my blood sugar barely moves. If you're cutting out carbs and fat, you're going to have to eat mainly lean proteins, and excess protein can cause a glucose response in some people. 

If your doctor recommended you to cut out fat, know that this is probably based on outdated (and disproven) ideas about saturated fat, cholesterol, and heart disease. You'll want to check with your glucose meter to see how you, personally, respond to fats before you decide to keep them or cut them out. (With the caveat that I'm referring to unprocessed animal fats from meats and dairy and natural fats from nuts and avocado, not processed plant oils like rapeseed or fried food.)

If you learn that your body responds poorly to carbs, I would recommend r/keto. Some other T2D have success with vegetarian/vegan whole foods diets, but don't dive in to any diet without testing to see how you respond first. You might be surprised to learn that supposed health foods like beans, whole grains, and fruit cause your blood sugar to spike, in which case you can rule out a veggie diet for treating your blood sugar.

Also make sure you're moving every day. This can be simple as walking or, in the case of lockdown, doing some chores around the house like mopping. But above all, I think the glucose meter and doing some testing and experimentation is your best bet for now.

fvcrnpo,BanditSixActual,2020-06-19 10:00,"My doctor didn't like keto, but gave me fairly low carb limits. I meet it with Huel Black Edition low carb meal replacement shakes for a lot of meals. 17 net carbs/serving. It's not really diet food, it's designed to be a 100% nutritionally complete alternative to fast food. I find that with the apple cinnamon flavor, I prefer it to regular food after awhile, probably because I feel more energetic. Serving cost is $2.21 per meal. I'm not hungry with 3 servings a day for a total of 1200 calories, plus probably another 150-250 calories worth of snacks.

Quesadillas made with carb smart tortillas, eggs with ham or turkey, beef jerky and sharp cheddar, or a In N Out double double protein style are other go tos when I just want flavor. Without the sauce, the protein style has 3g of carbs. I get it plain, add grillos dill pickles, grey poupon and a dab of nsa ketchup and love it.

fvck8ja,BanditSixActual,2020-06-19 8:59,"4 months ago, I had a similar diet with much more soda. I had to make some serious lifestyle changes when I got my type 2 diagnosis in February. People here like keto and it's a good way to start getting things under control. My doctor was not a fan when I mentioned it, stating that in her professional opinion, it's an extreme and extreme actions cause extreme reactions. She doesn't like the diet mentality in the first place, starving your body of things it needs in order to lose weight is robbing Peter to pay Paul. 

I took a different route, using a low carb, not no carb meal replacement shake called Huel Black Edition. Started out with 1 for breakfast, then added lunch. Now about 50% of the time I'll have one for dinner, because with the right flavor, I prefer it to other fast meal options. Doctor was doubtful until I showed up 3 months later 40lbs lighter and an A1C down from 11 to 6.5.

3 of them is only 1200 calories, so it leaves some overhead for some savory snacking. Extra sharp cheddar, dill pickles, and low sugar jerky are my main go to here. You wouldn't believe how much sugar is in most jerky. Zero sugar jerky tastes like shoe leather to me, so that's a bridge too far. A treat might be a In N Out double double protein style with pickles. Add some spicy dijon mustard because they have cheap mustard and I like it as much as one with the secret sauce and it's only 3g of carbs.  

Because of the predictability of my diet, I can figure out with the help of exercise logging what my pre breakfast glucose will be within 10 mg/dL. 

While my doc put me on metformin and I have a meter, that's really the extent of my medical intervention. That and regular testing. They're going to look at my A1C in November with an eye to removing metformin.

fwfe6u1,myristicae,2020-06-29 17:50,"What kind of headache was it? Like where did it hurt?

Excess CO2 *can* cause headaches (and other more serious things). I can imagine it could happen if the mask was very restrictive, such as an N-95 mask with a mostly clogged filter, but it doesn't seem like the most likely explanation. 

Just the pressure on your face or your head can cause a headache. For example, many people get headaches if they tie their hair up too tight or wear an uncomfortable hat.

Other possible causes are-

Stress from new situations (back to work during pandemic...)

Dehydration from not drinking enough water due to mask (this happened to my dad after working all day in a mask; he got so dehydrated his wedding ring fell off even though it's normally very tight) 

Tension headache from tensing neck/shoulders (again stress or maybe postural changes in reaction to mask) 

Migraine triggered by something, possibly something mask-related like a weird smell. 

I would recommend trying some different masks to find one that is comfortable on your head and doesn't restrict your breathing too much, unless you have to wear a N-95 for occupational exposure. You can experiment with earloops, back ties, etc, and different materials. I recently started making masks with a soft earloop made of jersey, and the earloop has a tail that can tie behind the neck which takes some pressure off the ears without putting pressure on the head. Point being, there's a million different mask designs right now, so try and find the one that doesn't cause you pain. It's true, wearing masks can be hard! I HATED wearing N-95s at work. I always felt like I was suffocating.

If you get another headache and you can take ibuprofen or another NSAID, I'd recommend doing that early on in the headache if possible. My instinct is to wait until it's really bad to take pain medicine, but it's much more effective if you head it off, especially if tension is contributing to the headache.",Topic 9,20-Jun,covid,/r/diabetes/comments/hic70e/mask_issues_anyone_wearing_mask_for_longer_period/fwfe6u1/,0

Regarding your question 1: 

Unfortunately, blood tests are needed to detect prediabetes and/or diagnose Diabetes.

According to Mayo Clinic (2018), health care professionals will use the Glycated Hemoglobin A1C test to check your average blood sugar levels for the past 2-3 months. This will check how much sugar has been attached to your hemoglobin (which are protein molecules in your blood). This test is only recommended every 2-3 months to closely monitor the sugar levels in your blood. Some other blood tests according to Mayo Clinic (2018), includes random blood glucose (RPG) tests, fasting blood glucose (FPG) tests, and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). If you want to read more about each of these tests, here is the website: [",Topic 6,20-Jul,covid,/r/diabetes/comments/hntxvr/type_2_diabetes_questions_for_a_dummie/fyot04x/,0

For your question 1 about if there is any other way to get tested for type 2 diabetes other than blood test, unfortunately, blood test is the only way as of today to determine if you have diabetes. Once you are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes through a blood draw test, to manage and monitor blood glucose daily, you would be pricking your fingers using a glucometer. 

For your question 2, although type 2 diabetes cannot be completely reversed to prediabetic stage, it can definitely be managed and lived with. The managing of type 2 diabetes almost entirely depends on you, if you check your blood glucose regularly and comply with your physicianâ€™s plan of care, exercise regularly, eat healthy, and manage stress effectively. I know it is so much easier than said, but on the brighter side, being able to manage your own health like in the cases of type 2 diabetes is sort of a relief as many other health conditions may exacerbate regardless of the efforts people put into keeping themselves healthy.

You also asked in your question 3 about warning signs of type 2 diabetes. Some of the symptoms of diabetes include frequent urination at nighttime, being extremely thirsty, losing weight without any changes in your diet or exercise, feeling hungry often, feeling extremely tired, changes to your vision (blurry), numbness or tingling feelings in your hands/feet, dry skin, getting sores that heal slowly, or getting more infections than usual. If you see these symptoms happening, please make sure to consult your physician. 

I am not a medical doctor, please follow the advice of your primary care physician. I can answer questions, but my information does not replace what your primary care physician states/has stated.

holzc9,G-Town_Exile,2020-07-10 2:34,"I'm an insulin dependent T2. My BG was stable on Metformin 1000mg XR for 3 years post diagnosis and then fate struck. My health took a series of hits that has hospitalised me 5x in the last 3 years. I've also endured 3 surgeries on top of that. The last being 2 weeks ago (surgery in COVID times is an experience). 

None of my health issues are a direct result of being a diabetic but as you all know, being a diabetic does one no favours. All these health issues have pushed my diabetic disease progress forward dramatically (hence the need for insulin). My doc is of the opinion that my diabetes has progressed to roughly where I could have expected to be 15-20 years from now, over the last actual 3 years. 

The latest surgery (2 weeks ago) destroyed my appetite (no real reason why). I've also lost 8 kg. My surgeon has been firm that no exercise is allowed until mid August the earliest. I must note that I have been eating regularly but only because I know I have to.

Since I was discharged, I have struggled to control my BG. It hasn't been high, rather it's been too low to the extent that last night I dropped to 2.2 mmol/L. I've never been this low before. I really feel for all you T1's who have to deal with type of situation regularly. 

I have yet to see a reading over 6.8 no matter what I eat. Last night I ate 3 large spoons of sugar to correct the low and my BG peaked at 6.7. All this happened before I'd even injected (I take long acting insulin only). I skipped insulin last night, ate a high carb meal before bed and still woke up at 4.7

I'm fortunate in that I have excellent medical coverage, see private (not state) doctors and can afford other expenses. My doc is excellent and treats all the other members of my extended paternal family as well. 

T2 is a genetically strong 'gift' in the male line on my dad's side. My aunt and none of my female cousins have it, but my dad, 2 uncles, both my brothers and all my other paternal male cousins are all T2. None of them have ever experienced what I am going through now.

I have obviously seen my doc and communicated again with her this morning. I'm making the appropriate changes in terms of meds and insulin as prescribed by her and her explanation of why I'm experiencing this makes sense.

While I'm going to do what my doc says - has anybody else ever experienced something like this and how did you go about maintaining your BG?",Topic 2,20-Jul,covid,/r/diabetes/comments/holzc9/insulin_dependent_t2_struggling_with_seriously/,Insulin dependent T2 struggling with seriously low BG.

You became a T2 diabetic not through any fault of your own, but because you have been given poor nutrition advice since you were child, as were all the rest of us. The government guidelines and advertisement told us that we should eat a lot of grains because it's ""heart healthy"", avoid fatty foods since it will clog your arteries, and drink fruit juice because it's good for you. This ""health"" advice lead to an enormous spike in the prevalence of diabetes. To deal with this disease you have to come to the understanding that all this ""helpful"" advice is wrong.

The processed food industry got on the bandwagon and removed the fat from their products. This made the food taste terrible. Therefore, they added sugar in to take its place. High levels of especially fructose(half of table sugar) causes non alcoholic fatty liver disease leading to more insulin resistance and ultimately T2 Diabetes once the pancreas can't keep pumping out more insulin to keep up with the incoming carbs from the diet.

It's not your fault that you became a T2 diabetic, but you end up having to deal the problem. Right now other people seem to not have this condition (chronically high insulin and high blood glucose). However, If they keep on doing the same thing they will unfortunately end up in your position. 

As you may already know very low carbohydrate diets are the way to go to handle this disease. Please go and check out the /r/keto,  /r/carnivore subreddits or the links below to learn more.

Weight is down a little but has slowed down 190-ish right now, ideal would probably 170-175 based on the dad-bod.  I lift 3-4X week and take walks. 

I am still eating keto - drifting towards carnivore-ish.  I supplement DHA - I don't like fish, so no salmon or sardines.

Depending on what I learn at the urologist I will have to think about TRT.  I feel better and my levels were up, although the Free Test was still low.  But the ED hasn't gotten any better.

It's important to me to control it as tightly as possible and avoid medications. For the first several months after my diagnosis last year, I cut out virtually all carbs and started intermittent fasting. Once my numbers were on the low end of normal all the time, I started allowing occasional exceptions. Mostly the exceptions are small items with 15g-20g of carbs like half of a normal-size candy bar or a mini Haagen Dazs bar -I can eat those without my blood sugar going above normal. At Easter I bought a package of a dozen mini Cadbury eggs - 6 or 7gcarbs each and it took me about 2 months to finish them off. Three times this year I've eaten high-carb meals - pad thai twice and a sub. The pad thai brought me higher than I like, but not too bad but I stayed normal after the sub.  

For me, soda wouldn't be worth it - just too much sugar and I've never been much of a soda drinker anyhow.

idmttu,BurblingCreature,2020-08-20 17:54,"Okay, so I've (25F) had relatively high blood sugar for a *long* while now. Too long, I definitely admit, but true nonetheless. I say relatively high because I know people live with worse, but it's definitely not good, when I do measure my levels it's around \~200-250 after eating but can get down to \~120 after waking up or after not eating for a while during the day. I don't measure my numbers nearly as often as I should, maybe a few times a month, so I don't really have a baseline for how I'm doing other than my A1C which was recently around or 8.4, if I remember correctly. Also, I'm only on metformin for my diabetes - my doctor seems fairly confident that this along with the effort on my end will be enough to bring my numbers down... he's more confident in me than I am.

&amp;#x200B;

All that said, I ""frequently"" (maybe once a week?} will experience faux low sensations and will feel as if I'm about to pass out or have a heart attack. I'll shake and start feeling chills as if I'm dying, so on par for my melodramatic ass.

Whenever I've tested my numbers during this time they come back fine, so I know it's just a faux low that I'm experiencing and my blood sugar is just coming out of the too high range and I'm not used to it.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - My main concern is this: Can someone **actually** pass out from a faux low? I know genuine lows are something to be concerned about, but what if your blood sugar is actually fine and your body is just in that ""I'm ridiculous and don't understand how numbers work"" phase? Is there any way to relieve the symptoms of a faux low other than just toughing it out until your body readjusts? I understand I did this to myself and need to do the hard time to remediate the results, but is there anything I can do to at least make the symptoms a tad less extreme until they fully subside?

iji9yf,Sariell,2020-08-30 12:00,"Hey there /r/diabetes.

I'm a Type II diabetic, diagnosed in January 2019. 38, female, currently 266 pounds. Originally, my doc put me on metformin, 500mg morning/night, but it made me super sick. I just dealt with the frequent trips to the bathroom and managed to lose 60 pounds over about 8 months. (probably from all the said trips to the bathroom immediately after eating)

I then started cutting my dose in half, that helped some, but I was still getting sick everyday. My doc gave me the 500mg slow release, and that still made me sick. I finally asked my doctor to prescribe me something else, so she put me on Glipizide 5mg once a day late last year. I gained about 30 pounds back. 

In February, I moved across the country for work/personal reasons. My blood sugar was on the high end of normal, but I'll admit I didn't take it and record it consistently. I started taking a 1200mg fish oil, 5000 IU vitamin D and 1000mg cinnamon in the morning with my Glipizide.

Three weeks ago, my heart was racing and wouldn't stop, so I drove myself to the hospital. I had eaten a meal I shouldn't have, but I didn't know why my heart was racing and was scared it was something else. They did an X-Ray, EKG and tested my blood. My sugar was 300, so they put me on an IV and sent me home. I tested it when I got home, and it was down to 200. I drank around 40oz of water before going to bed.

Since then, I've been trying to eat as many foods as I can that I found listed on a few sites as being blood sugar-friendly. My typical day: (1700ish calories)

**Breakfast**

one slice mulitgrain toast

one egg (fried with one spray of coconut oil, salt and pepper)

1oz fresh avocado

one slice pepper jack cheese

brewed coffee, one tbsp of natural bliss creamer


**Lunch**

3oz chicken breast

one flaxseed, low carb wrap

2 tsp caesar dressing

2 tsp parmesan cheese

2ish cups of organic spring mix greens


**Dinner**

3-4oz of chicken breast or pork tenderloin

2 cups roasted broccoli (misted with olive oil, salt and pepper)

usually either butternut squash (1/2 cup) or roasted mushrooms (1 cup)


**Snacks**

one bag of skinnypop popcorn

a smoothie made with 1 tbsp flaxseed, 1/2 cup plain fage 0% fat greek yogurt, 1/2 cup blueberries, and ice

Water consumption is 4x of my 32oz water bottle, so 128oz/day. I don't drink anything besides my water and the one cup of coffee in the morning.

My sugar reading in the morning, in these last three weeks, has steadily declined from ~200 down to 140-150, but now won't drop below that. The evening reading is almost always 95-115. I've been adding some exercise back into my routine, right now it's 30 minutes of cardio about 2x a week. I do plan on increasing this.

Is my diet wrong? I'm trying to keep my carbs to around 100-120g, should that be lower? Should I switch to something more like keto? I'm concerned the extra protein and fat will cause me to gain. Is not enough activity the problem?

I just feel lost. I've lost 3.5 pounds in these three weeks, but it seems like I'm doing things wrong. I did recently, finally, get a doctor in the area. (I'd been doing telehealth for checkups and med refills while I called doctors like crazy trying to find one to take me) I'm going for the full metabolic panel tomorrow. Should I wait for those results and see what the new doc says?

Great to meet you here. I wanted to share my story as I have spent the last 7 years in school, working with health departments and departments of public health to understand what is at the core of Diabetes and how it can help. My training includes Functional Nutrition training (to get to the root cause) as well as MS studies. 

To get back in control of my body I've needed to: 

1. Correct nutrient deficiencies (daily struggle)
2. Find the right kind of exercise
3. Maximize my digestion
4. Understand what my body is trying to tell me through symptoms
5. Look carefully at the relationships in my life -- work, family, friends -- and how they were contributing to my health and how to strengthen my personality to have these not be an issue anymore. 

I am curious have you all:

* overcome your diabetes completely (so you can even eat sugar again),

I am reading how much more terrible Covid can be for diabetics. But I am also reading that the rate of infection is not more for diabetics, just the severity if contracted. Im not seeing any actual numbers for infection rates of type 2 who have to be admitted to hospital. Im trying to fix the BMI as fast as possible and keep my numbers under control.

We were basically given a half priced trip to Disney World for our Anniversary in December (we were engaged and married there so it us a special place for us). I have asked people we know and Ive watched bumerous youtube videos of people visiting the parks recently. It seems as if there is an incredibly low volume of people in the parks, there are many safety measures being strictly enforced, and everyone Ive talked to or read have been saying its the safest theyve felt outside of their home. We would be driving about 16 hours not from a mandatory quarantine state and driving right back afterwards. 

 However, I also know there is some risk with doing anything right now. We go minigolfing at a low volume place, we go to grocery stores, and we pick up take out once in awhile. So its not like I am living in a bubble. And I do know things can change between now and December but I cant see the future and I need to make the decision relatively quickly.

g3xlxl8,BlackMirror765,2020-09-03 18:18,"A few things to say. Type 1 is an autoimmune disease where your body just fights your pancreas, resulting most or complete loss of insulin production. Type 2 is sometimes able to be controlled with diet. Type 1 can be helped with diet, but they will need insulin to live. Type 2s can sometimes never need insulin, but a lot do because they donâ€™t control their blood sugars and end up burning out their beta cells. Here is what I think you need to understand, most importantly: donâ€™t allow yourself or your doctors to get caught up in the â€œis it type one or twoâ€ game and lose sight of getting normal blood sugars. I was misdiagnosed for 14 years as Type 2 and let myself think it was not as bad as being Type 1. So I was not rigorous enough with my treatment, demanding normal sugars, or hard enough on my doctor. Regardless of type, YOU DESERVE NORMAL BLOOD SUGARS, and you should demand that from your doctors and yourself. You can truly thrive. Having said all that, it took me years, and being diagnosed as Type 1 after all those years, to think this way. It was Dr Bersteinâ€™s Diabetes Solution book and a wonderful endo/CDE that git me back on track. I highly recommend that book.

ioboui,BubbaChanel,2020-09-07 10:20,"First of all, ðŸ¤¦ðŸ»â€â™€ï¸ why didnâ€™t it occur to me to come here sooner?

I already have rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogrenâ€™s, so quarantine has become a way of life along with working from home. Long story short, things began to happen months ago that were signs that diabetes was about to crash land. It culminated in late June with a visit to my brand new PCP telling me my blood glucose was 375, my a1c was 12.7, and that I was now diabetic. I was in shock, and asked, â€œCan we call it pre-diabetic instead?â€ Gotta try to keep that sense of humor, right?

Two days later I saw an endocrinologist who told me the same thing, and had me test my blood and give myself my first insulin shot in her office. I then went to the drugstore and picked up a massive bag of bits and bobs related to said diabetes.

I went home and shed a few tears while drinking my favorite beverage on earth: a real cane sugar Pepsi. I knew it would probably be one of the last ever, if not the last. And I was mad. I canâ€™t drink, donâ€™t smoke, and doing drugs just never was a thing. I hate drinking water, and used to quote W.C. Fields on why: â€œFish f*ck in it!â€ 

Iâ€™ve made some changes, and the worst number Iâ€™ve seen in 4 weeks is 188. Iâ€™ve gone from insulin to Trulicity, but I didnâ€™t mind the insulin, it hurt less! I havenâ€™t gone above one Metformin a day because my stomach rebellion game is strong. I got a Libre on Saturday, but the numbers are about 15-20 points lower than the finger stick, so Iâ€™m doing both for now. Iâ€™ve lost 20 lbs, which is great, and a good start.

Iâ€™ve also seen a pulmonologist recently, and asthma has been added to the pile.

But, I havenâ€™t seen my coworkers, who are also good friends, or my closest friend, or my elderly parents in almost six months. Of course we talk, but it isnâ€™t the same. I have all these new doctors, but I donâ€™t know their faces. Itâ€™s like a conversation with a mannequin. Virtual visits are a bit better, but still not ideal.

I feel oddly disconnected from the outside world. I live in an area where Corona keeps creeping because people refuse (despite there being a statewide order) to wear a damn mask in public. Therefore, I avoid said public. 

Despite my other health issues, I wasnâ€™t freaked out by them. I was ALWAYS afraid of diabetes, though. I keep mistakenly referring to my Trulicity as Truvada, which has definitely sparked some interesting conversations.

Any suggestions for really good snacks, food hacks and funny stories would be much appreciated.

See, diabetes is not a disease of high blood glucose even though that's what causes most of the complications, but a disease of insulin resistance. You need to reduce your insulin resistance so that you can reduce your circulating insulin, which will allow you to lose your liver and intramuscular fat, which will cause you to be able to be even more insulin sensitive until hopefully you get to the point where you don't need medication.

ior11i,sparty219,2020-09-08 3:15,"Like an alcoholic on a binge, I fell off the wagon this weekend in the hardest way possible.  After 2.5 years of carefully watching my food intake and following the rules, I completely lost control over the past 4 days.  Iâ€™m not going to claim to never cheat because that would be a lie.  I actually think the occasional cheat helps maintain my mental health so I do it once in a while in a very moderate way.  

There was nothing moderate about the last 4 days.  I lost it and, sitting here this morning, itâ€™s like a bad montage scene from a movie, in my mind.  Pizza, cheeseburgers, fries, dinner rolls, alcohol, cookies - all float past as vague â€œyeah, I ate that tooâ€ memories.  

I really donâ€™t know what happened.  Iâ€™m generally pretty level headed but Friday I just started feeling overwhelmed.  The unrelenting ugliness in the news, the never-ending pandemic, being unemployed while watching my wife trudge off to teach high school, the fatigue of having a disease that will never go away - somehow it just all added up to a â€œscrew it, Iâ€™m at least going to eat what I wantâ€ tantrum.  

I didnâ€™t test the entire weekend.  Deep down I knew seeing the number would shock me into better behavior and I wanted the next chocolate chip cookie more than I wanted to be healthy at that moment.  Today, it was time to face the music.  Morning fasting blood sugar - 150; about 40 points higher than average.  Ughhh.  Talk about an early morning slap in the face.  

So, here I am after my â€œlost weekendâ€.  The news still sucks, coronavirus is still around, didnâ€™t magically get a job, all the problems are still here but Iâ€™ve added a temporarily screwed up blood sugar to the mix.  Iâ€™m a genius, arenâ€™t I?

The moral of the story is simple.  A cheeseburger isnâ€™t going to solve your problem.

g4fjvr2,Lausannea,2020-09-08 4:29,"&gt; Iâ€™m an idiot.

You're a human being who set their standards too high and is blaming themselves for something that is not really going to have any long-term effect on your health. You're ignoring the 2.5 years of absolute ass kicking this disease and you're elevating 4 measly days of ""Fuck the world"" into a punishment when that's really not needed.

Were these 4 days the best way to cope? Probably not. But did you cope? You did. During a pandemic, during a really tough time when everything feels like it's imploding in on you, with obviously no viable alternative that helped regulate your feelings in a helpful way. And now you're feeling more equipped to go back to your routine, and maybe you can figure out better coping mechanisms moving forward.

There's no shame in what happened. It's a symptom. If you had a better coping mechanism that gave you a 'breather', you would have utilized it, so instead of beating yourself up for being a human being, try to direct that energy into figuring out better ways to manage your feelings. It happened, nothing can be done about it now, but you CAN change things moving forward. And you WILL mess up again -- nobody is perfect -- but you can practice being kinder to yourself and in turn minimize how long it takes to get back in the saddle. Guilt doesn't help us, forgiving ourselves and not dwelling on our mistakes works so much better!

I'm 32 and I've had disordered eating since I was in my early teens. I didn't get diagnosed with diabetes until I was 23. Food is a powerful coping mechanism in the absence of better versions. I'm still not perfect, I still have binges, but compared to 10 years ago I'm doing SO much better. I've had years of therapy, years of accepting myself, and years of forgiving myself to allow room for better coping techniques. I can understand why you did what you did, and from one human to another: it's okay. You're still worthy of love and support, including from yourself. Just because your problems didn't get solved doesn't mean that what happened was worthless. You coped. You're still here. You're still capable of doing the things you want and need to do.

A meter will not be enough to diagnose you on its own, you will need further blood tests that your doctor will run. 

You can start testing prior to seeing the doctor: take a reading first thing in the morning, right before a meal, and 2 hours after a meal. Anything over 140 mg/dL fasting, 120 mg/dL pre-meal, or 160 md/dL post-meal _may_ be a sign of diabetes. It also could be completely normal, as bodies are all different.

Fortunately I do have some better news: nerve damage is generally slow to develop, and if you _do_ happen to have diabetes, you and your doctor will work together to get you on the treatment regimen you need. If properly treated, you should have no problem living a normal life. Hitting the gym &amp; making healthier food choices will go a long way in that regard as well :)

Now that you know, and now that you've had a wakeup call, you can make the positive changes that you need to. Metformin isn't a punishment for being a ""bad diabetic"", it's a very useful drug that can help you by limiting how much glucose your liver pumps out.

But what you can do is reduce the amount of carbs your eating, and get more exercise - and it doesn't even have to be a lot of exercise. Go for a 30-45 minute walk every day. Do manageable stuff you can stick to. With those two simple changes you CAN make progress. And also, make sure you're checking your blood sugar often. Maybe more than your doctor even recommended.

g6uqtdq,lveg,2020-09-27 7:59,"Sorry you had to join the club, but welcome! 

The best thing you can do is to check your blood sugar before and again 1-2 hour after eating to see how food effects you. You already have a meter, so that's great! You might need to test yourself a lot in the beginning but know that it's worth it, and will give you a much better idea of how you should eat. 

Secondly: know that carbs are going to increase your blood sugar more than any other nutrient. That's not just sugar, that's ANY kind of carb such as bread, pasta, rice, starchy vegetables like corn and potatoes, fruit like bananas, etc. It's a good idea to download an app like My Fitness Pal on your phone to start getting an idea of the nutrients in the things you're eating. 

A lot of people on here suggest type 2 diabetecs do /r/keto. I really recommend reading over the FAQ there because it'll give you a good idea of what to be eating. The keto diet is VERY low carb (20 grams A DAY) and I think it's a good way to lower your blood sugar  initially, but you may not need that kind of carb limit long term unless you actually want to. Every diabetic is different and can handle different limits, but personally I'm finding if I stick to 20 carbs or less a meal, I'm fine. 

There are lots of low carb products you can try, but you can keep it pretty simple. A typical meal for me is just some kind of protein + vegetables. Tuna salad and carrots, chicken wrap in low carb tortilla + avocado and tomatoes, etc. Sometimes I'll do half an apple with cheese, but fruit is an issue for some diabetics. If you're one of them, know that berries are your best option.

Next: exercise! I don't know what your lifestyle is currently like, but know that exercise and physical activity are a great way to burn glucose and keep your levels reasonable. You don't have to become a gym rat, but if you're currently pretty sedentary, consider adding a 30+ minute walk to your day. If you've been sitting around for a while, get up and do the dishes or something. It can be as simple as that. If you want to do something more rigorous go for it, but this is the kind of baseline you can aim for.

Iâ€™ve been doing fairly well with my diabetes since diagnosis, and even when on vacation Iâ€™ve been doing well.

These past few days though, Iâ€™ve noticed my sugars staying elevated longer spans of time despite... not much changing in my dietary habits. Even my drinking (vodka and diet soda) which has increased during covid times, has slowed down now.

I guess this isnâ€™t really heading anywhere. My last a1c was 5.8. The sugar im concerned about is 132 2 hours after lunch. My doctor will likely tell me i am being dramatic during my appointment tomorrow.. but it concerns me. Iâ€™m used to being in the 70s-100s and i never stay so high after eating.

jr8jlc,ilikedumdumjuice,2020-11-09 14:56,"24m here, pretty much every older person in my family has type 2. Last year got the typical symptoms of rapid weight loss, weakness, low appetite, peeing a lot, thirst and hair loss. Blood test showed 25.4mmol/l (oof). Doc gave me metformin and a few other drugs and told me to come back later. Told me i was type 2 but couldn't confirm because of my age. I was in denial so didn't take care of myself but also was too busy with my job so my health was terrible.

Come august of 2020 and I got laid off and moved back with my parents. Went for a checkup and my a1c was at 13.5, At home my fasting sugar was 10 and 2 hours after eating would max out the meter. (yikes). Doc prescribed humalog twice a day and the typical excercise and diet changes. I'm actually making decent progress now: fasting is usually 6-7 and I feel *soooo* much better physically and mentally.

But I'm really worried now. All that progress was possible only because I had the time to exercise and parents would take the effort to cook healthy meals. My new job starts soon and that's going to seriously affect my control. For reference: its a desk job and if its anything similar to my previous one then its long hours of sitting, inconsistent hours and somehow boring and stressful at the same time. So my questions are:

1. How to I eat healthy without without going broke? Fresh produce is more expensive than junk food and goes bad real fast. I may not have time to cook decent meals every single day or go shopping frequently. Only things with a long shelf life are carbs.
2. When do I exercise? I don't like gyms and prefer jogging and cycling but honestly don't have the time nor the energy after a long days work. I really want to put health first and money second but it simply isn't practical. I'm as lazy as it gets but somehow managed to get my butt off the couch but with a 9-6 job not including commutes i don't know if i can maintain it.
3. Related to the above: Life is more than just surviving. With adulting and sleep taking up most of the day, even if i somehow manage to cram exercise and healthy cooking into the mix there simply isn't time to do things i enjoy. That is Impossible to maintain long term and will certainly take a toll on my mental health which then will snowball into bad overall health.
4. I was always sedentary and very weak for my size but damn did diabetes take a toll on my muscles. Any recommendations to regain strength? preferably things i can do at home without equipment.
5. I want to get off insulin if possible. I absolutely hate needles and my heart races every time I take out the pen. Its only a short moment but it does hurt. Any advice for reducing the pain? I've tried many techniques but nerves are nerves and it still hurts every time.
6. How much is too much when it comes to cheating on my diet? I LOVE food: pizza, tacos, burgers, icecream and literally everything thats a cardinal diabetic sin. Luckily my lost appetite stayed lost or I could've eaten a whole pie by myself. Is cheating twice a week dangerous?

I'm a recently diagnosed type 2 diabetic. I have been prescribed metformin 850mg, which i take once a day. For a while i was on a low carb diet and my blood sugar levels were very good - within the normal range and lower - however the last few months i lapsed on my diet and my blood sugar sky-rocketed to around 8 or 9 on average. I have since gone back to a low carb diet (for 1.5 months now) but my blood sugar is still high no matter what it always higher than 7 but usually as high as 8

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are:  


* If i don't do anything to reduce my blood sugar - hwo long until i do myself permanent damage and start to see health problems?
* Should i increase my dosage of metformin?
* Why is my blood sugar so high now even though i'm very low carb? It doesn't seem to be re-adjusting to normal, like it did before.

I can't contact my diabetic nurse and she refuses to respond to emails...but i'm unsure if this is worth another consultation as we just had a consulatation a couple weeks ago, but my blood sugar still hasn't come right like i thought it would since then and since going hard no my low-carb diet.

gepohb1,t40,2020-12-05 9:03,"I'm an artificial pancreas researcher, working on hospital APs for exactly this problem.

The short answer is that your pancreas is more than likely just fine, and you needn't worry about worsened diabetes; they were simply doing their job and saving your life.

The long answer is that, when we get terribly sick, our bodies have a cascading hormone response, starting mainly with cortisol (the stress hormone). When cortisol is released into the bloodstream, your cells start to take up more glucose (as part of the fight or flight response). Because low glucose is very dangerous, your liver breaks up a ton of glycogen, which is basically like sugar that's been placed on long term storage for these kinds of situations. It ends up metabolising so much glycogen that your blood sugar levels soar! For a non diabetic person, you could easily see 180-200mg/dL, and if you factor in severe disease and diabetes you could be looking at even higher levels, sometimes going to 400mg/dL or higher. For reference, normal is ~100+/-20 mg/dL

So why did they give you insulin? As it turns out, the hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) you experience has kind of a positive feedback loop in it; the higher your sugar, the longer you stay sick and the more likely you are to die, especially with COVID. This has to do with a whole host of things that I won't get into for brevity's sake, but needless to say, it's in your best interest for your sugar to be kept stable around 100-140 ish mg/dL, and by giving you insulin, the nurses were pushing your sugar back down to a more normal level, which overall improves your outcomes dramatically.

Once you're well again, the hormone cascade stops and everything goes back to normal, usually with no lasting damage. My guess is that you're still fighting the virus (since you were released early), and your blood sugars are reflecting that.

&amp;#x200B;

2019 - My glucose and overall blood tests were raging. SGPT, Fasting blood sugar, HbA1c, Cholesterol, Lipid Profile were all abnormally beyond their bounds. Diagnosed with mild tachycardia and nocturnal hypertension. I Sought help (practically went to all kinds of doctors- thank god insurance exists) and worked my way with my diet slowly. It wasn't perfect, it wasn't fancy, I still don't exercise but I just stopped overeating and tried my best to control emotional binge eating (i also have anxiety and depression).

&amp;#x200B;

2020 Q1 - With only metformin and ""proper lifestyle"" (aka exercise 30 mins daily which I was too lazy to do) as a prescription, it couldn't bring my glucose down. My hba1c was still 10. Doctor decided to put me on Jardiance.

&amp;#x200B;

2020 Q2 - Took Jardiance religiously with metformin. Couldn't exercise still due to the lockdown. All I did was sleep on my bed and type on my computer. Tried my best eating ""better food"" but it still wasn't perfect. I am still overweight (literally did not lose any lbs). Not reporting to the office also lessened my stress and anxiety. Results showed I lowered everything (SGPT, cholesterol, etc) but they aren't in the normal range yet and my HbA1c now became 6.10. Doctor was happy, parents were happy, I was proud.

Food I ate? hmmm.. normal food. Nothing special. I'm kinda broke due to the lockdown and healthy food is expensive. I ate canned goods, fast food, and veggies.

Opened up to my doctor and my dad that I want to lower my hba1c to 5.40. Doctor said I shouldn't be bugged by my hba1c because IT IS EXCELLENT and my dad is kinda worried I might hit ""low blood sugar"" says it's too low of a goal.

But I think I really should hit that 5.40 goal. Why? Because i'm not 30 years old yet and my metabolism is still functioning much much better than people in their 40s or 50s. If I don't control my glucose now ang make it as normal as possible, then i'm afraid that 6.60 might become 8.0 when I turn 35 and then 10.0 when I turn 45 years old.

I realize this may be compression - as Iâ€™ve read that if youâ€™re laying on a sensor it can read false lows, but I find it odd that after ***both*** times Iâ€™ve woken up almost immediately. 

Iâ€™m type 2 (and still kind of new to the game), and Iâ€™ve honestly only ever experienced two lows to date that Iâ€™ve been awake for, so the fact that I may be experiencing them every night is kind of terrifying me. How can I know if these are actual lows, and if yes, how do I keep them from happening? I eat a protein bar before bed and I thought that was sufficient, but clearly not.",Topic 7,20-Dec,noncovid,/r/diabetes/comments/kblfi5/first_day_on_libre_questions_help/gfi2mhp/,0

My understanding is that steroids cause increases in blood sugar, and that infections also cause increases in blood sugar.

She got home from hospital just last night, but now her blood sugar is at 450 (got up to 400 twice in hospital, this was the first time she'd ever gone past 220 or so).

ghrzsxf,illisson,2021-01-01 16:30,"Honestly, the idea of an uncontrolled diabetic going to a gym during The Covid Times is setting off all my alarm bells.

I and all the diabetics I know (including the ones who're super well controlled) have been avoiding public indoor spaces as much as physically possible. We've all been getting our exercise with at-home equipment, or outdoors with masks on.

I already had a bunch of weights and bands and stuff at home, and added a super inexpensive (like, 80 USD?), non-electric treadmill to my setup early this spring, when I stopped using my apartment complex's machines. I love it and how convenient it is! I use it a lot more often than I did the complex's machines, just because, uh, I'm lazy and don't enjoy exercising, so even getting dressed and trekking across my apartment complex to get to its gym felt like too much effort sometimes. Now I can just hop on whenever I want, with no hassle.

Gym memberships are great, but I'd caution him to stay away from indoor spaces unless absolutely necessary--especially one where people are breathing hard. But again, that's just me.

Edited to add: for clarity, we've all also been avoiding private indoor spaces. Basically, we've all morphed into hermit crabs, bunkered down in our own homes.",Topic 8,21-Jan,covid,/r/diabetes/comments/koj99u/my_dads_numbers_are_out_of_control_just_looking/ghrzsxf/,0

I started with numbers like that when I was diagnosed (and I dare say I'm probably a good bit younger than your dad is unless you are a very well written elementary schooler) and I was able to get my shit in line. Maybe I had youth on my side, but I took it REALLY seriously, changed my diet, exercised more, and now my A1C is in the 5's which is considered normal. It's gonna require work and making big changes, but he can still turn this around if he puts in the effort, listens to his doctors, and takes whatever meds he's being prescribed. 

He might want to talk to a nutritionist for additional help, but the best thing you can do as a diabetic is to check your meter before and two hours AFTER eating to see how foods affect you. I am not no carb, either, but I stick to 25ish a meal and it works fine *for me*.

Two Saturdays ago I got a blood test ordered by a doctor, it said I had a fasting blood sugar of 189 and an A1C of 9.5. I'm a 26 year old male, 5'10, 240 lbs. So yeah I definitely need to shed some weight, and I've been on that. On Christmas Eve I got a telehealth appointment with an endocrinologist who specializes in diabetes, and she advised I go on a low-carb diet, decrease portion sizes, and cut down on my sugar consumption. She prescribed me Metformin 500mg which I take after lunch and dinner. She also instructed me to keep track of my glucose and below are the ranges I've been getting for the past week or so:

Morning before breakfast: 190-210 

 Right after a meal: 300-320

2-4 hours after meal: 230-250 

I've been so busy this past week that it hasn't really sunk in as to how high these numbers are based on what I've seen on the Internet. Unfortunately since it's New Years' Day and a long weekend, my doctor nor her nurse is around to answer my questions

These days, he usually has around 150 in the morning before breakfast and around 250 before lunch. We've finally ended up having to give him 5 units of insulin before lunch. He then has average values at night when he checks.

He hates having to give himself insulin (trying to move to a pen type) and says that something is causing the high sugar levels. He also wants to eat half a fruit at night after dinner and also lunch. His doctor suggests that he only eat a fruit before lunch and never after food.

gjpv3a3,Lausannea,2021-01-18 5:31,"I think those are generally fine numbers for someone his age. Elderly folks are encouraged to have an A1C around 8% if they're diabetic, which averages to around 180mg. The reason for this includes that they're more susceptible to low glucose events and not feel them, and those are much more dangerous on the short term than high glucose levels. Low glucose levels can lead to passing out, which makes broken bones highly likely and are a significant contributor to death in elderly. Efforts to bring A1C to below 7% are therefore often discouraged because they are more likely to contain low glucose events.

That said, if he needs insulin, he needs insulin. Obviously he does need to continue making an effort to manage things.

There are options for avoiding injections. Look into insulin ports; they're cannulas inserted under the skin for up to 3 days and stuck to the skin with adhesive, and a port to stick an insulin pen needle or syringe into. It makes injections painless because the needle goes into the cannula, which is already in the skin. It's the same thing diabetics with pumps use, except their cannula is attached to a tube which is attached to an insulin reservoir in the pump. You take it off on day 3 and replace it, which reduces the amount of insertions to one every 3 days. It's great for people who experience a lot of pain with injections and needle phobia.

l3n1cq,mxKittyCat,2021-01-23 15:14,"I guess background?  I was diagnosed last year as T2 after some blood test for an unrelated treatment. My bloodtests at that time showed me at 163 bg w 7.4 A1C. I had never been told of having high blood sugar before, but I've recently gotten access to my past blood tests (diff hospital) and they show I've been &gt;120 since 2016.

The doctor that ordered the bloodtest sent me over to the hospital's ""diabetes specialist"" to get treated for it. Well, that """"diabetes specialist"""" put me on metformin and told me I don't need to test and don't need insulin. I was having problems with my insurance and it was during the 1st C19 lockdown in my state, so trying to get in control of my health took a backseat.

I've been on/off sick all week and yesterday went in to a walk in clinic bc I could tell something wasn't right. A UTI diagnose later, I've got a follow up Wednesday bc the doctor (and nurses and like... everyone else Im having to talk to about it) cannot believe that I was diagnosed, put on metformin, and told NOT to test. Despite on/off vomiting/diarrhea and not being able to eat much my bg was still at 126 w 6.4 A1C yesterday.

So I *do* hope the doctor I'm seeing will continue to take this seriously and I'll get what I need, but like...

What should I expect? I'm assuming she'll tell me to get a tester. My current Metformin rx is 2x 500 mg tabs with meals twice daily (so 2k mg for a full day).

I know basics about nutrition. I know that all carbs (except fiber) turn to sugars and that lowering carbs can help. I'm not 100% sure bc it was a while ago that I saw the specialist, but anyone IRL I've talked to about even moderate low-carb in relation to diabetes has kind of given me a horrified look. So IDK if there is a universal consensus of ""This is good, this is okay in moderation"" type of eating??

On a personal note, if you got diagnosed later in life, how did you come to terms with it? I'm trying but at the same time it feels like what's the point? It will almost certainly not go away, at best I can hope to manage it with constant, daily monitoring and thinking about every damn thing I put in my body, and at worst it will kill me in one of the multiple ways it can.

My diabetes is reasonably well controlled on metformin (1000mg 2xDay) and exercise. Last A1C was 6.3. Got the first shot of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine last week Tuesday (2FEB2021).

I am scheduled for shot two on 2MAR2022, and I'll provide an update for that about a week after.

I will say if you get the vaccine (and you definitely should imo), I was offered to sign up with the CDC V-Safe program, and I highly encourage you to participate with that. The first day I got about four text messages with links to a quick survey asking how I felt and if I had any related medical things I'd like to report, and every day after, once I day I get a message asking for a quick update.

ljjjdj,mtempissmith,2021-02-13 22:57,"Money is super tight this month because the SSA took more than half of my SSI check until I get out of the shelter. Plus they say they overpaid me so for the next six months they get yet another $100 as well. Basically after I pay for my locker and phone I'm living on less than when I had cash assistance and food stamps. 

This month I had an extra bill I didn't count on so I'm living on about $100 all month. I can't eat much of the shelter food except for cereal which isn't great for me so my blood sugar levels are all over the place. I'm trying to live on what I can afford which is basically ramen soup and a few packs of lunch meat to augment that, peanut butter and honey/jelly sandwiches. I did get two packs of carrots and some salad stuff but that was it. My diet is TERRIBLE period, let alone in terms of my diabetes. This neighborhood food costs the earth and it's almost all junk food. I can't cook here much. I end up eating takeout or soup 99% of the time. 

I get so frustrated with this. 

I just want to get out of here and find a place but the shelter isn't helping much with it and finding a place I can afford on disability is like asking for the moon. The city voucher thing is a joke. You can't get anyone to take it. So you sit in a shelter and wait, and wait, until they finally get around to finding you an SRO room or apt. It's been over 2 years for me and I'm just fed up. I'm not going to get my blood sugar under control living like this but I can't get stable enough in terms of housing that I can cook and really control my diet. 

It's slightly lower than it was last time they did blood work which is good but it could still be better. It's not that I eat that much sugar except for in cereal. Too many carbs. Rice, beans, noodles, cereal whatever is needed to stretch my food supply. I am really hoping next month that we get the $1400 stimulus. I have to put at least $1200 away towards housing but I will be able to keep the $200 at least. It will replace the payback money at least. I'm hoping to move out of here this Summer somehow, at least to a room I can cook in. 

Do you ever do this? Eat badly because it's what you can afford and then get frustrated because your blood sugar is too high? I miss being in a house and being able to cook real food. I could make a couple hundred bucks last so much longer that way. I had a freezer and cupboards to stock up food. I didn't end up eating cheap carb junk just because that was all I had access to. 

Just venting but I am so glad this is a short month and stimulus is happening in March cause I'm sick of freaking noodles and rice and PJ sandwiches! Before Covid put us all in hotels we had churches and stuff who used to bring us food to the shelter. It wasn't the best food but now I actually miss it. It was mostly chicken and rice but it was still better than the toxic stuff the shelter serves. That stuff it can literally put you in the ER if you are not careful. Been there, done that twice now. It's that bad. 

Mostly when I have more money I eat chicken rice and beans from the Hispanic places. There are American fast food places all over but it costs too much. Just getting a burger and FF here will set you back over $12 so it's not something I do very often. I'm not too sure how healthy the rotisserie birds are though and all that rice is horrible for my sugar. But that's all they serve pretty much. The only veggies they have are mixed carrots, potatoes and broccoli. Can't do that because of the broccoli. I'm allergic. Potatoes, carrots I love them but I can't indulge because they send my sugar sky high. 

I think I spend way too much of my time trying to figure out better options. The whole GI diet thing it just drives me nuts. Between my food allergies and the diabetes the list of what I should and can eat is so short compared to the stuff I shouldn't or can't eat it's absurd. It's not so much the giving up sugar. I am doing pretty well with that, but the carbs thing drives me crazy because 90% of what I have access to, can eat, and can afford is mega carbs. 

Anyway I am ranting, I guess. I just needed to vent, sorry. It's just so much harder to do this diabetes thing homeless than I ever thought it would be. I need to check my blood sugar again in the morning but I just dread doing it. I don't even like to check.

gndnpny,mtempissmith,2021-02-14 0:54,"Most of the Latin places here are takeout chicken places. There are some Asian stores but they don't have much I can take back. The Latin places will do rice and beans with a chicken. It's usually red beans, nothing else. I can't have canned food and they are picky about bringing in food in plastic containers. They even give us a hard time bringing in fast food, particularly drinks. Bringing in cans of beans? Forget it. 

They really make it very hard to eat healthy. Even the salad stuff I get grief for because we are not supposed to have any raw veggies or uncooked meats.  I can barely get away with cold cuts and prepped salads from this one bodega that does them and that's not too cheap besides.  I do have a little fridge and I try, but actually cooking is a real challenge because there are only two microwaves downstairs and the guards watch them closely to make sure you are only warming up leftovers. We're not supposed to actually cook here. 

I make the ramen with semi hot water from my bathroom tap because they are technically illegal, semi-raw noodles.  I run hot water over them and soak about 5X and it's almost like cooking them for real. They don't bug me too much about them if I do it late at night downstairs but bringing them down during the day usually will get me yelled at. I've had them take them a couple of times so I don't usually do them that way. 

If I bring back burgers and fries or pizza sans the soda usually they don't squawk. But if I go to the grocery and buy a few real groceries they tend to get in my face about it. I can't bring in but so much by way of cold cuts or salad stuff. I can bring in a jar of PB and some bread but if I get too ambitious and buy a normal amount of stuff for a week they get testy and tell me not to do that. Mind you we're supposed to be quarantining not going out every day shopping. 

They want you to eat just the shelter food basically no matter how bad it is. Because if you don't they will get less food and less money for other stuff because the funders think they don't need it. But I've literally suffered unstoppable projectile vomiting and ended up in the ER twice eating food here. I've seen food packages a year old, well out of safe range, remarked for a more current date and given to us. 

It's like they don't care. They have a fridge that is supposed to keep our milk in the downstairs area. Do they use it? Nope. They just leave the milk out the whole time the meals are being served. Everybody knows not to touch it unless it's cold because it will be spoiled and it will make you sick. 

I do what I can, what we all do. But it's not anything like having your own place and being able to really cook. For the record they come in every few days and check our mini fridges. If they think we have too much or anything looks like it might not be 100% fresh out it goes. This place is anal about us not having much of anything and that doesn't mean just food. I've had them come in and tell me to get rid of half my clothes or my toiletries. They don't even let us put a picture taped to the wall because that means we are ""too comfortable"" maybe. The hotel is better than the actual shelter by far but we'll be back come Summer or so we have been told. 

Not me. I am not going back there, living in filth with 11 other women in my room. I just can't do it again. It was absolute HELL and I'm done with that. This situation as severe as  it can be is like a paradise compared to the regular shelter. I'm saving most of what I got. Anything I get, stimulus, whatever, most of it goes into the housing fund. I'm not happy half starving so much but when I finally have a place and don't have to live like this anymore I will feel it was all justified. 

My goal is to get my butt outta here. If I have to eat junk food and ramen till then till I'm sick of it, I will. But I tell you what when I finally have a place and can cook again I never want to see blocks of ramen or PB or rice and beans EVER again....LOL",Topic 1,21-Feb,covid,/r/diabetes/comments/ljjjdj/diabetes_being_homeless_its_the_worst/gndnpny/,0

It was pretty bad. They actually tried to serve me broccoli and cauliflower 3x even though I told them I was allergic and gave me grief for not eating it, wouldn't give me anything else. They also tried to give me meds I was allergic to twice despite my telling them I was allergic. 

My blood sugar numbers at the time were not that high but the doctor immediately tried to put me on drugs and insulin which my regular doctor had not prescribed.

fj29hv4,iqlcxs,2020-02-28 16:59,"It really depends on what number you start at and how your insulin resistance is doing.  When you are first diagnosed with a high a1c your insulin resistance is very high and so are your fasting numbers.  Over time if you eat low carb, your fasting numbers will decrease and so will your insulin resistance, as long as you don't take insulin as well.  

Over time you will find that the same high carb foods have less effect on your blood sugar.  It's kind of like driving. If you are going very slow and you turn the steering wheel an inch, you don't go very far, whereas if you are going 60 and you turn it an inch you might be in a different lane.  Your insulin resistance is kind of like the speed you are going.  Less insulin resistance, less response to foods.

When I eat a burger these days (after eating mostly keto for a year and low carb for 4 years since diagnosis), I only usually get a rise of about 40-60 points on my glucometer.  But because I average around 80 pre-meal a 40-60 point rise is no big deal. If I continue eating like this then I start having trouble though because my circulating insulin won't clear before my next meal, so my insulin resistance goes up.

However, what I'm also finding out is my numbers are low.  Well not low persay.. more like right in the green zone, when otherwise I struggled.  I haven't taken any Novolog for the past 4 days.  Another variable is I started back taking my Metformin, and it's entirely possible the Metformin is a contributing factor too.

But even at mealtime, I'll drift up to around 150 or so and then pretty quickly I'm back flirting with 100, sometimes below, sometimes just above.

I eat very low carb, maybe around 20 a day. I exercise 5-6 days a week, about 30-60 mins a day. I do yoga, light weights and low impact cardio. The first two weeks or so, as my body was adjusting to lower numbers, my nerves started doing a weird pin poke thing. It was something Iâ€™ve never felt, beefier DX Iâ€™ve only felt the occasional pins and needles and it went away quickly. The pin pokes were all over my body, like someone just poking me in all different places. Iâ€™d wake up in the middle of the night hot and sweaty and prickly.it went away after a few weeks, my dr said it was my body adjusting to lower sugars. Fast forward to this last week, I started feeling those hot needle pokes again. I noticed after or during my exercise Iâ€™d feel tingly and prickly. And then last night, all up and down my body . From my head to the bottom of my feet and everywhere in between. Itâ€™s been miserable today, Iâ€™m feeling prickly all over. Iâ€™m feeling aches and pains in my lower back, needle pokes all over, my legs, arms, back, face, stomach . I have been having good numbers today and I donâ€™t know what it could be. Iâ€™ve emailed my dr and talked to another who says it doesnâ€™t sound like neuropathy. Nothing is numb. My fingers are a little tight. But not where I canâ€™t move or close them. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s what Iâ€™m eating or not eating , if I pulled something or pinched a nerve. I never felt like this before . Never before my diagnosis, change of diet and starting exercise.Before diagnosis I felt fine , well with the exception of blurry eyesight, more thirsty and frequent urination.

fj2xxkw,Evenoh,2020-02-28 22:35,"Uhhh hmm. I have two thoughts and of course Iâ€™m not a doctor. One is that it almost sounds like a rash or reaction to medication - is anything red with the needle feeling? And two is that maybe itâ€™s unrelated and you have some autoimmune thing developing. Oh now I have a third thought and maybe you have LADA, not type 2, in which case youâ€™d be autoimmune with insulin resistance. 

I havenâ€™t had trouble like you describe in lowering blood sugar and sudden weird symptoms, but I do get weird joint pain and swelling and itâ€™s been linked to low magnesium. Might be worth asking your doctor to test that as a quick lab test wonâ€™t hurt and magnesium lactate is pretty simple to supplement with. I also get really itchy skin sometimes but as far as I can tell, thatâ€™s linked to my Hashimotoâ€™s (autoimmune thyroid disease), hence my suggestion that it sounds autoimmune. 

 What you can try while waiting for doctor response is just easing up on the exercise a notch and keeping your low carb intake spread out over the day so the lower numbers stay steadier. Not a solution but also canâ€™t hurt you in this temporary time. The less your numbers go up and down, the better chance at minimizing the needle feeling if itâ€™s related to your body adjusting to lower numbers.

Type 2 diabetes was in my family - father, mother, and at least 1 grandparent.  During my pregnancy I was ""borderline"" but that was years ago so probably diabetic by today's scale.  Today I'm considered pre-diabetic diagnosed 4 years ago with an A1C of 6.5.  

I've come to see it not as a specific yes or no disease (though it can go there).  My A1C recheck is due soon but I might be below the pre-diabetic range now.  That means very little to me though.  It's not like I can declare myself cured (ever) and just eat a normal diet.  If I did, then I would suddenly be ""diabetic"" or ""pre-diabetic"" again.

If it rears its ugly head during pregnancy, it probably means the metabolic parameters are in place.   Deviations from low-carb, exercise, and low bmi are likely to result in blood glucose problems at some point.

None of the T2's in my family were obese either though not skinny either.

Abstractly, I now see it as a furnace with a rating.  Some of us have low rated furnaces and our furnace may malfunction if overly taxed.  This is why obesity drives people into T2 status and why they find it more reversible - perhaps they were just over-taxing their furnace so to speak.

fg6go8,bootdinker,2020-03-09 19:09,"Hi all,

I've been Type2 for 15 years now. I don't want this to be an advertisement for any one particular drug, but more as an example of what can happen if you are willing to insist on new treatments if your current regimen isn't working for you. 

Injectables didn't exist (I don't think) when I was diagnosed back in 2005, and once they were on the market my doctor had it in his head that I didn't like shots, so he never prescribed me them. Instead, we kept working with varying doses of Metformin, Xigduo, Janumet, etc. All that did was make me hungrier. From 2005-2018, I went from 165 pounds to 230 pounds, and at 5'10"" that's a significant amount of weight to carry around. I was frustrated, my doctor was frustrated, and I was seriously considering picking up a meth habit on the side (or at least cocaine) just to lose weight.

I had read an article about Ozemplic (new at the time) causing people to lose weight. He told me he was steering clear of injectables because I was afraid of needles, and I told him that must be some other patient. Since my insurance covered it, we agreed to try it.

From April 2018 to July 2018 I lost 30 pounds without trying. There were side effects for the first few weeks, including a few bouts of extreme nausea, but I could handle them. Constipation followed for a month or two. But I was losing weight! And I was losing weight because, quite simply, I wasn't as hungry anymore. I could go hours without a meal and when it was meal time, I didn't feel like I needed to eat a whole lot to feel full. I remember ordering a Quarter Pounder meal as a treat and leaving half a burger and most of the fries. I was just done eating. 

Those 30 pounds are on the high end of what an injectable will make you lose. Best case scenarios are usually 3-10% of starting body weight. Even my doctor said I lost more weight than any of his other patients. 

But here's what those 30 pounds gave me: confidence to start moving in the right direction. Once I got those 30 pounds off, I joined a gym, hired a personal trainer, and spent 2019 just getting back into shape. I'm not ripped. I think based on body fat I may still be technically obese, but I'm back down to 175 pounds and it feels great. My pants went from a 40 inch waist to a 33 inch waist. I rarely have to wear slacks at work and today I had to dress up, only to find that all eight of my belts were too large, even on the smallest hole. None of this would have been possible if I didn't get that first ""free"" bump that got the ball rolling downhill. Without the change in my prescription I'd be sitting at my computer in 42 inch waist pants.

My A1C at its worst was still under 7 (just barely) but for the past year it's been 5.0, then 5.1. My annual physical is coming up in three weeks and if my numbers are still good, the doctor is taking me off medication altogether.  

None of this would have happened if I didn't find something that ""magically"" worked for me. If you are in a rut, your doctor telling you to exercise and lose weight won't do any good. Exercise makes you hungry, especially cardio. You should sit down with your doctor and tell them you want to lose weight, but you need help doing it. If the solution is an appetite suppressant, so be it. If it's a new injectable, then that's what you need. Some doctors will assume because your blood sugar is under control that their work is done. It's not. You can get to a point, even as a Type 2, where your body is in a place to help YOU. Your doctor should be trying to get your body to that place as well, but sometimes you have to ask.

Good luck to all of you. My younger brother is Type 2 as well, and while he didn't lose 30 pounds on a different injectable, he lost 15, and that was enough to get him moving in the right direction. He only did it because I told him to walk into his doctors office and demand something else besides Metformin. Once he got results, he started making his own results. You can, too. Don't settle.",Topic 2,20-Mar,noncovid,/r/diabetes_t2/comments/fg6go8/if_your_t2_treatment_isnt_working_for_you_ask/,"If your T2 treatment isn't working for you, ask your doctor for something different"

I was a vegetarian for awhile in my younger years and learned how to cook tofu pretty well.  Some marinated, baked tofu makes a perfectly nice low carb snack.  Some places carry pre-marinated tofu that you can just eat out of the package.  If you're not used to it, the texture might take some getting used to, though.

Healthy blood sugar probably won't make you less likely to become infected, but it can help you fight it off more quickly and easily. More troops in the fight, a war on only one front, if you will. Sounds like you're in really good shape in that regard.

fkubf8d,Oshiet,2020-03-18 8:43,"**TLdr: sugar levels still really high, should I be concerned in a questionable work environment, even when I'm taking extra steps to stay safe for myself?**

My a1c is 8.6, from a 10.4 end of last year. It's still high as hell, I KNOW... I'm working on it - stress and life events aren't an excuse to slack off from the exercise and diet control and I'm paying for that choice right now.

My issue is, I work as a marketing coordinator on an administrative team in a large medical group under OptumCare, which is a subsidiary of United HealthGroup. 
The work I do can mostly be done from home, but I know it is not an essential FT job, like our patient facing workers, which means I could possibly face cut hours or even a layoff. I'm pretty low on the totem pole, I make as much as our Medical Assistants, but don't actually help in the office patient interactions (I take care of the social media, branding standards in the multiple offices, and patient &amp; in house communications).

With COVID19, I am concerned. My sugar levels are still high and I'm already dealing with the toll on my body (stomach pains and nausea)... should I risk asking to work from home or do I play it safe with my job and continue my day to day routines at the office? 

My other concern is my direct supervisor is not taking this seriously and I'm scared to be around her. Last time she had ""bad allergies"" (it was definitely the flu) she did not sanitize her work stations, wash hands, or cover her coughs/sneezes. Because she is the wife of one of the board of directors, no one is even going to question her when she uses her husband's name to try and justify her actions.

I started keto/low-carb in July 2019. At the time my A1C was a 6.9 with the help of 2000mg Metformin and 5mg Glipizide. I saw immediate changes in my blood sugar readings, as well as gradual improvements ever since. 3 months after starting keto/low-carb I had my A1C rechecked and it was down to 6.2. After 6 months or so I was able to stop taking the Glipizide, but I find the Metformin is still necessary (though a missed dose of Metformin doesn't seem to result in highly elevated blood sugar the way it used to). One of the biggest changes I experienced immediately is that the distance between my high #'s and low #'s shrank considerably. Pre-diet change my blood sugar was bouncing from 85 to 165 (all before meal or 2 hours after meal readings). After making the dietary changes my blood sugar is generally between 95 and 115. The only exception is my first reading before breakfast when the wretched Dawn Phenomenon often has my blood sugar up to 120-135. That flatter, tighter control feels better (which is why it drives me nuts that I'm struggling with the Dawn Phenomenon as that plummet from 135 in the morning to 95 by lunch tends to leave me with a headache).

I still have a loooooong way to go, with a lot of weight yet to lose (another 100+ lbs) and greater control over my carb intake yet to obtain (I'm really only low-carb, not keto). I expect that there will be continued blood sugar improvements as the excess fat goes away. I don't really expect to quit taking Metformin given some of what I've read about it's benefits and family history when it comes to diabetes. For now it's enough that I was able to avoid insulin and eliminate the Glipizide. I know Metformin isn't for everyone, and I certainly wasn't happy about needing to take something (dependence on society continuing to function and medical financial stability makes me nervous), but it's a useful tool if it's an option, so I'm using it while it's an option and doing what I can to make changes that will help me cope if there should come a time when taking Metformin is no longer an option. And, for what it's worth,  I started taking Metformin when my A1C was 7.9 and feeling horrible, and using the meds to help lower my A1C so that I could start to feel better is what gave me the ""oomph"" to tackle a major dietary change.",Topic 7,20-Mar,noncovid,/r/diabetes_t2/comments/fjeb6c/keto_question/fko8u25/,0

A diabetic is diagnosed with a test of your A1c. An A1c is the three month average of your blood sugar levels, because your blood cells live for 3 months. 

5.6 and under is considered normal. Under 5 is ""optimal"" 5.7 to 6.4 is considered pre-diabetes. 6.5 and up is considered diabetes. When you're above 9 you are in the danger zone. Doing irreversible damage to your kidneys, nerves, and eyes. 

I was diagnosed on December 16 with an A1c of 13.5. This is like, ""Hey, we're getting ready to amputate your feet"" level of diabetes. 

My doctor and I chose to see what I could do to without being prescribed meds and not using insulin. At my three month check up we would re-assess and if I needed to be put on meds, we would start. 

Today. March 16th. Exactly 3 months later.

I see stories from people on here who were diagnosed with a lower A1C than me, have had their diagnosis for 5 years, and are proud of their ""hard work"" that has gotten them their lowest a1c of 8.2. And that's while on meds!

This may be hard to hear, and I get why, but if 8.2 is the result of ""hard work"" good luck because you're going to die. Try harder; do more. Your feet, your eyes, your kidneys, your life is literally on the line.

""Not everyone can do that because they'll get burnt out."" Fuck that. Everyone can do it, they just need to be willing to sacrifice and change their relationship to food. I promise you, 4 months ago, before I got my diagnosis, I would have gotten just as angry at someone who was saying what I was saying. But when I see diabetics saying things like, ""it's a marathon, not a sprint"" it makes my blood boil. YES it is a lifelong disease, and it's a progressive disease. That means we should be shooting our shot immediately! As soon as the gun goes off that starts this marathon we should be giving it our all. 

My goal was simple. Get my A1C down as low as possible as quickly as possible. Because I wanted to stop the irreversible damage that happens every day with a high A1C. Plain and simple. That's it.

Now, if what you mean is that you're not willing to make the changes (not that you CAN'T) I can accept that. I think it's fucking dumb as hell, but I can accept it. If certain foods are more important to someone than their health, and they are willing to admit that honestly, more power to them. I hope they enjoy their short lives. Me though?

fks947e,rharmelink,2020-03-17 15:41,"For me, the r/keto way of eating was the answer. A good intro would be to read that group's FAQ.

At it's simplest, keto is just ""Minimal carbs. Adequate proteins. Fats as needed (for satiety).""

Before keto, I had an A1c of 7.3 while using both insulin and metformin. Since starting keto over three years ago, I no longer use T2D medications and my A1c has been as low as 5.2 without them. I was able to stop insulin immediately and weaned off the metformin months later.

My boilerplate on foods and recipes:

*** 

There are so many low carb options...

There are lots of low carb veggies â€“ mushrooms, cauliflower, cabbage, broccoli, green beans, peppers, sugar snap peas, asparagus, radishes, celery, artichokes, onions, Brussels sprouts, tomatoes, ...

There are lots of proteins -- eggs, chicken, pork, beef, lamb, fish, seafood, ...

There are lots of fats -- olive oil, butter, avocado oil, heavy cream, coconut oil, mayo, cheese, ...

There are lots of nuts and seeds -- walnuts, pecans, macadamia, almonds, chia, pumpkin, sunflower, ...

There are lots of spices -- Salt, pepper, Italian seasoning, smoked paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, ginger, curry powder, ...

There are all kinds of sauces and condiments -- tomato sauce/paste, mustard, SF ketchup, SF BBQ sauce, salsa, guacamole, horseradish, SF jams/jellies, tartar sauce, ...

There are lots of baking supplies -- coconut flour, almond flour, flax meal, psyllium husk, Xanthan gum, extracts and SF syrups, unsweetened coconut or almond milks, artificial sweeteners, ...

And so many I left out. Almost an infinite number of combinations.

fkrulqq,LeoMarius,2020-03-17 13:19,"Diabetes type 2 is a function of genetics, age, and weight.  You can only control one of those.  If you have immediate family who are diabetic, you are at higher risk.  The older you are, the more likely do develop it.  There is a direct link between obesity and diabetes, although there are lots of fat people who are not diabetic and lots of moderate weight diabetics.

When you are sick, it's just harder for you to respond to your normal biological urges like hunger and thirst.  You also sweat more when you have a fever, so you dehydrate.  Since you are feeling awful, you have less desire to get up and pour yourself a drink of water, so you drink less.

Diabetes compromises your immune response.  That's why it takes longer to heal.  When fighting a virus, a weaker immune system means the virus has more of an advantage.  COVID 19 settles in your lungs and can cause pneumonia.  If not properly treated with a respirator and perhaps tubing, you can die of asphyxiation.  Diabetics are more likely to get pneumonia from the flu, which is why you are recommended to get a flu shot annually.

Ask them again at your next appointment, or if you have some other way of contacting them (I can talk to my doctor through an app, but I think it's just glorified email). 

Whatever tests check if any insulin is being produced came back indicating that I was producing some when I was diagnosed. That can happen in T1 before all the producing cells are gone, so my doctor still moved forward with just the T1 insulin treatments. 7 years later, that's been working and my patterns indicate pretty clearly that it is T1. We haven't re done the tests, but we haven't seen a need to.

In the early stages (for T1 at least) there can be a ""honeymoon"" period where the treatment helps the body successfully manage itself. I had a few months of incredibly good control. For T1s (including myself), this period inevitably ends at some point.

In 2017 I was off meds and did the c-peptide test and came out pretty low. But I was already on a low carb high fat diet for 2 years, which is known to influence the results on this test. Once in a while I needed to take metformin, but I was mostly managing with an active life. Last year my BG became harder to maintain, so I did antibodies test and it came negative. This confirms I am type 2 with very little insulin production capability. Some times I ask myself if it was my early adoption of low carb diet that made antibodies go away. Anyway, fast forward, I am now taking 2000mg of metformin each day, my fasting BG is crappy and A1C is 6.8%. From 2015 to 2019 I had very good BG and A1C values, used to be in normal levels of healthy individuals but they were slowly rising. What happened in 2019? My theory is that besides being on a low carb diet, I committed a few mistakes, like overeating, or sometimes eating too much carbs in social gatherings. I was too confident of my health because I was off meds. There is also another theory that is related to the type of fats I was consuming, but it's another story. Hope my story helps.

Well, in certain cases i do know what to do, for example when my blood sugar is running high due to stress or what not, and I have ketones for days, I know how to fix it - but it is extremely difficult to get access to. Specifically, I am referring to getting an IV. Why should it be so darn hard to get an IV and only Hospitals and ERs can give it to you? UC does not do it nor do doctorsâ€™ offices. I tried finding someone to do it without having to go to ER, but was sol. 

I am on the insulin pump and CGM, it makes my life significantly better. Last year I spend about 8K on my diabetes related medical stuff. This year is a bit better due to the insurance coverage we got. 

Anyways, I do not know what life is like otherwise. Does it impact my day to day life? Maybe, maybe not. I do not know. 

There also days when I just do not know why I am feeling so out of it. I suppose perks of life with T1D. 

I have come across someone who told me he doesnâ€™t not want to be with me because I am T1D. Hence, he is no longer part of my life. After having it for so long, and being transparent about it, well, that was a huge blow. 

I only have the most amazing people around me (except that one case), but that made me feel super uncomfortable.

fl6rfbg,grckalck,2020-03-22 5:42,"Take my drugs every day. Every single day. I havent missed a dose since I was diagnosed two years ago. Add fiber to keep from spending half the day on the toilet, a side effect of said drugs. 

Cut all bread, pasta, rice, grains, pizza crust, tortillas, candy, any starchy or sugary foods out of my diet. I read the Nutritional label on every single thing that goes into my shopping cart. Slowly re-integrate low carb substitutes, either home made or through product research. Right now, low carb eating is my default. If I go off script for lunch I still have a low carb dinner. Its become second nature after a couple of years. Yesterday was a Ham and cheese sandwich on keto bread for lunch and chicken breast steamed in my instant pot with spinach for dinner with my wife. 

Still no regular exercise. I feel even worse about not exercising than I did before my diagnosis, but I still dont do it. Right now today, my weight is the same as when I was diagnosed. I lost over 20 pounds last year and have gained it all back. I dont binge on potato chips and M&amp;Ms anymore, but sadly cheese sticks and pepperoni will do the trick at keeping the lbs on as well. 

Eating out is tough. By myself I just don't, except when I do, which is usually when I am tired or didn't plan my eating right so I am hungry when out and about and see those beautiful golden arches. French fries will be the end of me, to be sure. When I am out with family, sometimes I choose the low carb option, if its available. But a hamburger patty wrapped in lettuce with no fries that you have to pay more for than a plain burger frankly sucks, so I often succumb. Also, I hate being that person who says, ""look at me, I'm special, I cant eat what everyone else is!"". 

My doctor is pretty happy. A1c has been under 7 since my first diagnosis which he says is the goal for all his patients. I'm down from 3 month visits to 6 month visits. Metformin is pretty cheap, so that and a monthly box of test strips are the only added drug costs.

I was a T2D for about 10 years and split that time between taking care of myself with meds and exercise and being like, screw this, it's too much, I'll do what I want. Then last year, on top of a ""screw this"" phase, I had sciatica that was so bad I couldn't walk. It was all way too much to deal with, and eventually I landed in the hospital for a week with, bonus, metabolic acidosis. Followed that with six weeks in a care facility, with physical therapy for the back and controlled diet for the diabetes. 

I've been out for a few months and even though I now do a shot of Lantus along with metformin every day, my back is good, my numbers are good, and I feel healthier/better than I have in \*years\*. I really think in some weird way, it was all tied together -- and that experiencing actual consequences changed my attitude. I NEVER want to do last year again, so I constantly remind myself of how good I feel now, and why that is. It's so, so easy to forget all of that.

Since I'm seeing some discussion of it here: I pay attention to overall carb count but not calories or portion control. I'm very grateful this works for me because I also deal with ADHD and more tracking/constraints would be overwhelming.

Costs: I've had everything from zero to crazy good health insurance over the last 10 years. Fortunately, last year was in ""crazy good"" mode and all I had were some copays. My regular maintenance expenses -- meds, lancets, strips, testing kits -- are still around $100/month with that crazy good insurance. Needles for my Lantus pens make up about half of that. Also, definitely food. My grocery bills are \*always\* higher when I'm in Doing Good/Feeling Good mode. (The current situation in the world is also not a help at all, obviously.)

Resources: I don't consider myself keto but I frequent the recipe sites because keto has brought many more low carbohydrate tricks to the diabetic eating arsenal.

The problem with spiking as high as you're mentioning is that it's not possible to drop low enough to end up with a safe average. You've got to keep that top number down because you're looking at coma or death if you try to compensate for highs by going super-low. Also, though the average number may be what matters from a medical outcome standpoint, the Pharm-D also acknowledged that swinging from one extreme to another results in lower quality of life. It just doesn't feel good to bounce around from 70 to 220, so even though doing so would provide a (barely) acceptable A1C it's not going to provide good quality of life. It feels far better when your blood sugar has minimal variation. To be safe from cumulative damage you need it to hang out steadily somewhere in the safe zone of 70 to 135.

&amp;#x200B;

My insurance never covered Basaglar, even after my doctor attempted to intervene.  My doctor said I could continue to take sample Basaglar pens from his office and just donate the untouched Levemir to his practice when I got a chance (I always forgot to). This went on for months until a few weeks ago they ran out of samples. I asked the staff if they could ask my doctor if it would be okay for me to start taking the Levemir.  Their staff got back with a message from a nurse saying it would be okay.

&amp;#x200B;

This always had me a little nervous because every time I brought up using the Levemir (saying having to pay, it would just be more convenient) he made certain I would continue to use the Basaglar instead.  Also, having heard from the nurse instead of my doctor, I'm unaware if my doctor ever got the question.

&amp;#x200B;

So I've been taking 19u of Levemir for the past 2 weeks. I only test my sugar in the morning before I do anything.  It's slightly elevated, but honestly no that much (130-160mg/dl where I think before it was b/t 120-140).  The only thing that has stuck out to me in my own research between the two drugs is that Levemir appears to have a half-life of 7hrs where Basaglar is more akin to a full day. THIS, though is what worries me, especially w/ our new friend coronavirus lurking around, knowing that not just a low-glucose reading is important, but a CONSISTENT one as well (not spiking significantly throughout the day).  Should I be splitting the dose and taking it twice a day? Taking it closer to meals?

She kept increasing my metformin because my BG was high each time I'd visit (keep in mind these were weekly visits from the miscarriage and onward) and I was spilling ketones.  So she'd increase my metformin.  Then I'd start losing more weight.  She'd increase my carbs and calories.  Then my BG would be high.  She'd increase my metformin.  Oh, look! I'm losing weight again!  More carbs/calories.  Stupid bitch had me eating so much (and by the end of the pregnancy I was at 2000mg metformin a day) that I felt full the entire time I was awake.  I mean, I'd WAKE UP feeling full.  In the end, I finished the pregnancy at the same weight I started the pregnancy at, and now I had a much larger appetite than I'd had before because I'd been stuffing food in my face for so long that my body got used to it.  (I still hate that Dr and wish I'd fired her the first time she threatened to have my hospitalized against my will for the weight loss.  Unfortunately, I wasn't in healthcare at the time and didn't really know my rights or much about how it all worked.)

Anyway, I now have an 11yr old genius who doesn't seem to have suffered at all with my weekly changes in dosage and carb totals or my weight loss (which is what was really freaking my Dr out.  ""OMG!  Spilling ketones will make your baby a moron!"")  I think food plays  a much smaller role in the health of the baby than we think.  As long as you are getting enough calories for fetal development, you should be fine.

Bonus:  She didn't even catch my son when he was born.  She came into the room , checked and I was 9cm dilated (2hrs after water breaking, 15min after checking in at the hospital), proclaimed that I was having ""failure to progress"" so she was leaving the room to get some pitocin.

What has helped me with anxiety is that there isnâ€™t a direct causal link between just having diabetes and covid19 as there is for smoking and covid19. Itâ€™s pretty clear smoking damages your lungs and covid19 attacks your lungs so the link there is pretty clear.

As far as just having diabetes, just because your body canâ€™t regulate itâ€™s blood sugar in of itself doesnâ€™t equate to decreased lung capacity or weaker immune system. If your diabetes is out of control and has been for a long period of time on the other hand does lead to the degradation of nerves and organs. So you should be checking blood glucose regularly, taking your meds, watching your diet, and if you can while maintaining social distancing exercise, aka what you should be doing anyway. With heavy helping of washing your hands often.

Sadly a lot of people that have diabetes and/or hypertension donâ€™t or havenâ€™t taken care of themselves for a long time and may have damaged their immune system through the process. Which is where the links weâ€™re hearing about are coming from.

I had symptoms that fit under the criteria of covid-19 a couple months back. How may I have caught it? I live and work in an area where travel tends to be rampant. I work in a salon. It's possible that a client of mine carried it and passed it along (this was while there were *very* few cases in my area, I think there were 3 confirmed within a 100 mile radius at the time). I started coughing uncontrollably one day and left work after an hour and went home to rest. 

The next day, I was in immense pain. My chest especially felt like it took a beating. I couldn't breathe properly, I had a gnarly headache, and a sore throat. I was familiar with the flu, so at the time that's what i had figured and blew off the idea to get tested.

A week later, my voice was officially gone, and the coughing started to slow down. I was no longer in pain. 

The week after, the coughing was no longer painful, but comparable to congestion.

fm9qjr6,itsaquagmire,2020-04-02 17:38,"Iâ€™m type 2 and can help!

- inconveniences with current system:  I use the Dexcom G6. To me, there arenâ€™t really a lot of inconveniences for this system. I would say having to change your sensor site every 10 days, the two hour warm up period where you have no data and reactions to the adhesive. But, the G6 is one of the best systems out there, so any inconveniences I really overlook 

- prick mechanisms with pump: Iâ€™m guessing you mean you do you use the finger prick method with a pump?  I have the Tandem X2 Tslim, so when I go to give myself insulin for a meal, or a correction, I would have to manually type in my blood sugar number after the finger prick. However, the Dexcom and TSlim work together, and the Dexcom automatically has my blood sugar numbers already in the pump

- how painful is the process: it depends what method. Yes, finger pricks can be uncomfortable, but you get used to it....maybe on a scale of 1-10 itâ€™s a 2. With the Dexcom, inserting your sensor is virtually pain free. And since it continuously monitors my sugars I donâ€™t have to do anything

- how often do you measure: again, depends on the method. With the G6, in the past four months, Iâ€™ve only had to check my sugar with a finger stick once. Everything else is automatic. My sugars are on my pump, and I also have an app on my iPhone that has my sugars. I look at my watch throughout the day. But the Dexcom sends me an alarm if my levels are dropping or rising to fast

- who pays:  in America, it depends on your insurance. For my pump, itâ€™s covered under durable medical equipment. And I need to pay 100% of this cost until I meet my $3,500 deductible. Then supplies are covered at 80%. Just an estimate of cost- a 90 day supply of infusion sets and cartridges, just cost me $422. The pump itself i got last year. I had met my out of pocket max, so it was free. Otherwise, pumps run probably anywhere from $6,000-10,000. For my Dexcom, thatâ€™s covered under my prescription plan, so I (luckily) have a small monthly copay of $40. 

- noninvasive monitor: anything that measures sugars has to be somewhat invasive because it either needs to have contact with blood or interstitial fluid. The Dexcom is pretty noninvasive. But yes, I would be interested if there were other methods. I always want to have the best devices. 

- how much would I pay: I pay $422 for a 90 day pump supply order, so thatâ€™s a good amount....maybe $100-150/month",Topic 6,20-Apr,noncovid,/r/diabetes_t2/comments/ftxdcf/interview_for_mit_project/fm9qjr6/,0
fmaa8ox,SeaWeedSkis,2020-04-02 21:25,"Type 2 with a Type 2 husband -

-What is the most inconvenient part about the blood glucose measurement system you are using?

We use Accu-Chek Nano with FastClix lancet drums. Currently none of the ""inconveniences"" are significant and all are fairly equal in their level of annoyance. I say currently, though, because we are both relatively young and healthy so we don't yet have any diabetes-related vision loss or finger sensation loss. The main inconveniences that I think may be useful for you to consider:

1) My husband lacks depth perception (due to an unrelated condition) so he sometimes experiences difficulty with properly lining up the lancet with the place he intends to stab, or lining up the blood drop with the test strip (blood drops that smear instead of being sucked up into the test strip are annoying). I expect similar issues, but worse, will occur as we age and experience vision loss. My mother had Type 2 and lost much of her vision because of diabetes and was no longer able to see well enough to test her blood sugar without assistance. Talking monitors don't help with getting the blood into the test strip.

2) The lancet doesn't consistently discharge with the same amount of pressure. Sometimes just a slight pressure on the plunger will cause the lancet to fire, but other times I have to press further on the plunger before the lancet fires. This causes anxiety to build in the times when the lancet ""misfires"" and requires repeated attempts.

-How painful is the process of checking your blood glucose?

It varies, but can go as high as a very brief 3 or 4 on the 1-10 scale. The pain very rapidly disappears, fortunately. 

-How often do you have to measure blood glucose?

This also varies. I am ""prescibed"" once a day. My husband is ""prescribed"" 5 times a day. We usually check 2-4 times a day when there is a change in circumstances, such as a change in medication or diet or illness, or if we're trying to identify patterns to explain why our blood sugar is higher than desired. When everything is consistent we often go several days without checking, but typically will check at least once a week. Over the past 6 months we have averaged approximately 3 test strips total per day between the two of us (an average of 1.5 per person per day).

-Who pays for the insulin pumps and blood glucose measuring systems?

The glucometer, test strips, and lancet drums are all covered by our insurance with $0 copay (currently). 

-Would you be interested in a non-invasive blood glucose device?

This feels like a ""duh!"" question. :D Yes, of course I would love to be able to avoid having to stab myself to check my blood sugar.

-How much would you be willing to pay for this product?

That would depend on whether it was a one-time purchase (like a glucometer) or a repeated cost (like test strips and lancets). Financial situations change, so if finances permitted I would be willing to cover a fair bit of cost for a one-time purchase (depending on how non-invasive...eh, let's say ballpark $500 out of pocket), but for a repeated cost it's quite likely that insurance coverage would dictate whether or not I made the switch. For example, I much prefer the lancet drums that I use now over the lancet device that came with a glucometer I purchased. If my insurance didn't cover the lancet drums, and did cover the other lancets, I would probably not be using the lancet drums. If it was only $5-10/month difference then I might do it, but probably not for more than that.

Less painful then I thought it would be. Just annoying. 

Doc said once or twice a day for now. 

I go the system for free. Pay for the strips + lancets. 

Sure. 

If it saved money over the strips, that'd be a pretty good start. Paid $45 for 200 strips/lancets after insurance.

fmbigi1,culdesacrilege,2020-04-03 8:16,"Type 2.

I use two glucometers that I keep in two locations. The most inconvenient part for me is that brand names for glucometers are generic enough that it's easy to screw up and buy/order the wrong strips...which is how I first ended up with two glucometers. 

I don't use an insulin pump.

Checking my glucose ranges anywhere from I don't feel it to a brief, annoyed ouch. Being taught how to do it properly (side of finger, rotate sites) helped.

The minimum I can get away with measurement-wise is 2-3 times a day. I would like more data, but sometimes it's hard to stop whatever I'm doing, set up everything, test.

I pay for my testing equipment. My health insurance doesn't cover CGMs. Where I live, that would cost about $75 for two weeks. At some point I would like to wear a CGM for a month and track my food, in the hopes that I could get at specific results and effects more easily. If it cost the same as my current testing equipment, which runs about $30 a month, I'd probably switch permanently.",Topic 6,20-Apr,noncovid,/r/diabetes_t2/comments/ftxdcf/interview_for_mit_project/fmbigi1/,0

 As a diabetic you are indeed at high risk for cardiac issues, including those caused by high blood pressure and high cholesterol.  But it takes years, even decades to develop those problems so you do have a little time.  The very first thing is to get the diabetes under control.  After the social distancing has relaxed somewhat it would be good for you to discuss this with your physician and possibly see a dietitian.  Also, take a look at your family history since heart disease has a high genetic component, and knowing your history will help you assess your own risk.  In the meantime take care of your blood sugar first and don't worry about this for a while.",Topic 9,20-Apr,covid,/r/diabetes_t2/comments/g3z0ei/keto_but_what_about_all_that_fat/fnuocpg/,0
fnynem7,w_gee,2020-04-20 0:45,"I was right there with you 3 years ago. I was diagnosed right after I turned 30, my A1C (average blood sugar over the course of 3-4 months) was 9 something, average sugar levels were high 300s. I was terrified, confused and loaded with information overload. I was only prescribed Metformin though. 

I did a lot of reading and research, bc my doc at the time told me to limit my carb intakeâ€”which only meant to me then, bread, bread, potatoes, grains, etc. Little did I know it included all sugarâ€”fruits &amp; starchy veggies. 

But reading into DM2 (Type 2 Diabetes) will help you understand what is going on in your body. And you do have this support group and many more out there to reach out to if you need more answers. Usually after being diagnosed as well, your doctor can recommend a education class thatâ€™s usually free or covered by your insurance. 

As far as a â€œnormalâ€ life, that all depends on your outlook and adjusting to the changes. While we all try to aim for lower carb intake with foods, each food effects everyoneâ€™s sugar levels differently. So, the best you can do is make sure youâ€™re testing your sugar levels after certain foods youâ€™ve eaten... and make note of whether it spikes your sugars a lot or little. Like, I can eat a banana and my sugar levels only spike to 130, while on the other hand, eating pineapple can spike it 170. Again, itâ€™s different for everyone... test your sugars and keep track. 

For me, Metformin really suppressed my appetite... and it came with side effects (TMI-digestive issues); I took a lot of anti-diarrhea pills when I first started as suggested per my PCP. I would consult with your doctor if youâ€™re having side effects... maybe he/she can change up your dosages or meds. 

Exercise should also help lower and keep your numbers lower. 

I hope this all helps! Ive written a lot, sorry! Know youâ€™re not in this alone :) we were all there once. Donâ€™t hesitate to ask questions or know more about being a diabetic. 

Btw, 3 years later, My A1C  is now 5.8 (I fall in the prediabetic category, but still technically a DM2), and Iâ€™m also like 50lbs lighter and still aiming for more... unfortunately still on Metformin (Iâ€™ve been pushing my PCP to possibly take me off) and he would like my weight to be lower before doing so... sooooooo, yeah. Iâ€™m due for my 6 month check up in August and Iâ€™m sure that this quarantine hasnâ€™t helped my A1C/sugar levels since Iâ€™ve done a lot of bored eating of pantry essentials (starchier foods definitely).

fobqjso,keypress-alt-f4,2020-04-23 10:22,"Can you provide a little more info on why you're struggling with the CPAP? If it's because of air gaps, you likely need a different mask. If it's because you feel like you can't breathe right with it, it likely needs a different setting OR you need to move to a BiPAP device, which will change the exhale pressure vs the inhale pressure. I can't sleep at all with a CPAP because of this, but have no problem with a BiPAP. And the mask they gave me was wrong for my face, so I had to try different styles before I found one that really worked well. This totally solves sleeping for me.  


As others have said, don't worry about your blood sugar at this point - worry about your A1C. Your doctor can send you for that test and let you know if you're pre-diabetic.If you're worried about eventually developing type-2 diabetes, it's important to stop putting a hard load on your endocrine system, and the way to do that is to cut carbs from your diet. Stick to meats, eggs, fish, poultry, cheese and vegetables, and dump the chips, pasta, bread, sodas, juice, milk and other carbs.

g8cydu,dangitbobby83,2020-04-26 4:42,"Anyone take Glipizide and have persistent cold symptoms or sore throat? I know itâ€™s a side effect. 

This is a bit of a long story so I apologize in advance. 

March 13th, three days into our quarantine, I develop a...idk if sore throat is the right term. Itâ€™s bothersome, right, itchy, and really only gets painful after talking all day and eating. (With exceptions)

At first the doctor thought it was viral. Of course I freaked out, thought I caught Coronavirus. This triggered massive health anxiety in me. 

Right before that, I got serious again about getting my health back on track. I was diagnosed with t2d about 4 years ago. At first I did really well. First 6 or 8 months I went from a 12.3 a1c to a 5.7 or something. 

Then a year and a half ago, maybe longer, I fell off the wagon. Super depressed, didnâ€™t care. Stopped taking my meds due to laziness and picked up a pretty bad alcohol addiction. 

My a1c jumped to 8.5. Which is where it was last test. 

So my doctor, seeing it at 8.5 prescribed Glipizide. I didnâ€™t really take it either, only intermittently. 

Then covid hit and it shook me into action. I started taking it a few days before this sore throat hit. 

Iâ€™ve been taking it consistently and my bgls are now running between 72 at its lowest (and I suspect lower, Iâ€™ve had tremors and night sweats a lot) and 140ish at its highest that Iâ€™ve tested. 

Of course, much of this is to diet. No longer out of the house and trying to save money, I stopped eating complete garbage and eat a lot healthier. Far less carbs, far less calories. Iâ€™ve even gone into ketosis once or twice. 

However...besides the low bgl, I cannot shake this damn throat thing.

Itâ€™ll be 7 weeks this Friday. 

I *never* had any other viral symptoms. No cough, fever, runny or stuffy nose, sneezing, or anything else. 

The doctors said the throat looks viral but also post nasal drip and maybe Gerd. 

I finally read more about Glipizide and how it can dramatically lower blood sugar to hypoglycemia levels if youâ€™re not super careful. And then I read that persistent cold symptoms, including sore throat, is a common side effect. 

Obviously Iâ€™m tired of having this throat thing. I have health anxiety now, thanks to covid and this sore throat and between thinking I have covid and itâ€™ll kill me, Iâ€™ve also freaked out and thought Iâ€™ve had cancer, meningitis, sepsis, ear infections, and covid repeatedly. 

I tried to stop taking Glipizide for a few days to see if it cleared up but alas, the throat thing remained. 

Should I ditch Glipizide completely? This is the first 6 weeks or so Iâ€™ve taken it daily, consistently, except for the few days I tried to stop. 

I keep reading that itâ€™s not a great drug to begin with and even if my sore throat is not a result of it, a few nights of soaking wet night sweats and super low bgl (Iâ€™ve never seen my monitor display a number below 85/90 before) has convinced me that maybe itâ€™s not a good idea overall.",Topic 8,20-Apr,covid,/r/diabetes_t2/comments/g8cydu/glipizide_and_persistent_sorebothersome_throat/,Glipizide and persistent sore/bothersome throat

Over the years, my ability to amiably communicate with them has devolved into tantrums on my end about their diet and how they can heal themselves if the simply cut out carbs.

Being that I have a high risk myself, I switched over to a Keto lifestyle.  No sugar, bread, grains, starchy veggies etc. and I feel great.  In fact, I feel awesome as many of my ailments have disappeared (fatigue, prostatitis, halitosis and a few others).

I am now living with them due to COVID and my ""helpful suggestions"" have led to bitter disputes and hurt feelings.

It's hard to change people let alone parents.

In order to keep the relationship healthy, I have taken a semi vow of silence when it comes to food/nutrition discussions.

So, I must hold my tongue while I watch them eat the same foods that caused their current health situation in the first place (rice/beans, starchy veggies, lots of fruits etc.).  I eat these foods occasionally too but this is their staple.

They seem to rely more on the advice from doctors and mainstream media rather than seek out new schools of information.

fpqzt6v,TheWolfAndRaven,2020-05-07 0:43,"From what I've read, you start to see long term damage if you stay above 150something. 

A normal - (non-diabetic) would generally never be over 140, if you're testing below that, you should be good. However if you're going below I believe 70, you've got the opposite problem which is even more dangerous for diabetics as that's where diabetic comas and stuff happens. 

I'm still pretty new at all this and I've never experienced the shakes, so I'm afraid I don't have much advice. For now though, with my limited knowledge I'd say if you're testing below 140 you're off to a good start. 

What I would recommend is keeping a good log of what you ate, when and how you feel. If you can safely test when you get the shakes I would check that, and make a note of what time you get them pre or post meal. You may just need to adjust to a more frequent eating schedule where you eat smaller meals to keep your levels consistent.

gnyopo,yoshii316,2020-05-21 8:15,"So I'm new here, joined a few weeks ago to see if I could help gain some tips to manage this. I was diagnosed back in 2016 and for a year and a half I was good; exercising, watching what I ate, taking my med and watching my A1c. Then I got my job, driving  and working as a courier, which meant long hours on the road with little access to healthy, low carb food options and lead to poor time management and low motivation to exercise.

Then I turned 26 in 2018, which meant I could no longer be on my parent's insurance, and my job's health insurance was flaming garbage, so I didn't have access my meds. So my A1C jumped up to 14 and my liver function was terrible by the time I finally got insurance and had my first doc. appointment in Jan. of 2020. 

After being sent to the ER to get a shot of insulin (13 hour stay in the hospital before all this covid stuff began) and nearly all of February without meds, I was finally able to get meds.

Now, towards the end of May, I am happy to say that after being on Jardiance, Metformin and Trulicity, and with monitoring my diet, my A1c is 7, my blood sugar is within my range, and my liver function had improved dramatically. I still have some work to do on my cholesterol and I need to begin exercising, but I am glad I've made some progress.

TL;DR: After being diagnosed in 2016, I had poor management of my diet, exercise, and meds and my A1c jumped up to 14 in Jan. 2020. As of May 2020, my A1c is 7 and my liver function is improving.",Topic 2,20-May,covid,/r/diabetes_t2/comments/gnyopo/progress/,Progress

I had a nasty case that came on quite suddenly on my left shoulder.  Diagnosed promptly by my FP, who referred me to physical therapy.  It took several months of PT to regain function and range of movement.  Itâ€™s painful, but you have to just put the pain aside and allow the joint to stretch, plus do the PT exercises at home as well, between sessions.  With mine, after a couple of months of PT, one day my therapist was working on it and it just popped, loudly enough the whole room stopped and looked at us (probably waiting for me to start screaming...)  It was painful, but also a huge relief and the pain level dropped off very quickly, plus I gained back about half (or more) of my previous range of motion.

From then on it was a relatively quick recovery (a few weeks) and I eventually regained full ROM.  Apparently it can recur, so these days I make sure to do shoulder stretching exercises regularly, and work with weights. 

I also had a friend who had surgery for hers, but I know very little about that.

Substitute low-carb things everywhere you can. If there are things he just can't live without (as it were) then cut the portion sizes in half. MyFitnessPal helped me immeasurably the first year but you have to want to use it and be willing to get a little obsessive with it. Walking is generally the easiest, most low-impact thing he can do and if he likes the outdoors it's not tough to manage, even in the coronavirus times. If there are things he likes listening to, load up his phone and get some good earphones/buds. My wife went all in on finding new recipes for both of us. And keep checking back, this sub is one of the most helpful, supportive places on Reddit.

I will add this: *If* he's willing, you might try a continuous glucose monitor or CSM. It's a round plastic thing the size of a couple of stacked checkers with a very thin needle that you attach to your arm and leave there for a couple weeks. You can then use a monitor or a smartphone to check glucose levels all the time and see trends during the day and night.

First off, the AVERAGE age of cohorts in the study was 70. 

We already know that above 70, the risk of death scales drastically. Due to 70 being the average, this means there were a lot of people older than 70 whoâ€™s risk is really high. 

If you are under 60, your risk drops drastically, regardless of comorbidities. 

The problem with this study (and many studies like it)is that the ages arenâ€™t granulated. That means the information is nearly worthless to everyone but researchers. 

Next, get your sugars under control! 

Several reports have stated that 180 or under is considered â€œwell controlledâ€ and that people with well controlled diabetes has a similar risk as those without. 

Lose weight. Get your sugar under control with as much diet and exercise as you can do. 

Take vitamin D. There is correlation between low D levels and worse outcomes with covid. 

These are things we can control. By getting healthier, you are lowering your risks.

I realize that this group is focused on Type 2s but I always find generalizations which fail to recognize Type 1 or Adult Onset Type 1 diabetics somewhat irksome. More importantly, statements, such as the one being reported here, overlook the importance of stratification of mortality rates based on duration of illness. Diabetes, irrespective of its classification, but dependent on level of control and duration, is complicated by vascular pathology and COVID is clearly rapidly being understood to represent a vascular insult. Type 2s understandably have shorter disease histories than long-term juvenile onset Type 1s. I have been diabetic for 40 years and, whereas my HbA1c is 6.8% thanks to a CGM and carb restricted diet, I nevertheless have multiple comorbidities including Monckebergâ€™s sclerosis, peripheral neuropathy, hypertension, myalgia and chronic fatigue. So, although I miss the 60 year age cutoff and my diabetes is arguably controlled, I still consider myself at high risk should I contract the disease. The point Iâ€™m trying to make is that blanket statements are, at best, associative unless covariates can be better defined. One should also realize that to relegate those who fall under the tail end of a distribution curve as being expendable, when one is not in that subgroup oneself, is reprehensible. Many individuals who fall in an age group â€˜definedâ€™ by such comments as high risk certainly also are present in channels such as this one and are no less valued in society than the rest of us.

ft68wxk,Walk1000Miles,2020-06-06 12:43,"If you have been diagnosed with diabetes, it's a good idea to track your blood glucose (BG). However, if you do not have diabetes there is no use to track your BG unless you are curious.


Usually, your doctor will set you up through your insurance company, with a BG machine and other materials you need for the machine. When you get the BG machine, it comes with a small booklet. In that booklet, there is a chart that you can use to write things down (in regards to your BG levels, what you felt like that day, and other things).


I use MyFitnessPal to track everything. When I'm checking my BG, it stays in the meter memory. I write it out and forward it to my doctor.


He usually would get this information from my machine because when I go to see him I take my machine with me. 


However, because of the coronavirus, I write everything down and physically send it to him. I have virtual appointments.


Where I live, we have an application that enables us to communicate with all of our doctors and care givers. So that is how I send it to them. It also enables you to ask the doctor questions and check up on things, like all of your tests, future tests, exams, medication, test results, hospital records, bills, etc. It's a great thing to have. 


As far as a special application? I don't really use anything except for MyFitnessPal which works great for me. 


You can set up things that you want to track. Mine goes back really far. I forgot how many years. I think at least six because that is when I started using it I think, and it tracks everything. So you can go back 6 years ago or 3 years ago or whatever and see what your weight was or what your BG levels were or what your A1C was. It's really helpful when you want to examine what you have been doing in regards to trying to change to a more healthy lifestyle and it helps you track how your changes have been implemented and whether or not they have helped you.


Whatever you want to track, it enables you to track it. It has preset ones and then you can add your own. That's what I did.

A woman came in today that I hadnâ€™t seen in about six months (COVID-19 likely had something to do with that).

I put on my happy face as I walked in, since I always give them the benefit of the doubt, and asked her how sheâ€™d been. Turns out sheâ€™s made incredible dietary and lifestyle changes over the past several months and her glucose has been running between 100 to 120. She had to gradually reduce her insulin from 72 units a day and ultimately stop it to avoid hypoglycemia. Eventually, the maximum dose Ozempic and metformin dropped off, too. 

After telling me the full story, she said â€œI was afraid you were going to be mad at me for stopping the medication.â€œ

â€œMad at you? If it wasnâ€™t for this damn coronavirus I would hug you!â€œ

Visceral fat is the fat that accumulates on your organs, and kind of suffocates it, causing poor health and diabetes. Insulin resistance is when your pancreas tells your liver there is too much sugar/carb, no more sugar/carbs is allowed to be processed correctly. 

The insulin resistance comes before the fatty liver. Leading to all the organs getting fat accumulation (if the body continues to perceive that there is too much sugar/carbs). The shutdown of sugar/carb processing can be temporary or continuous, almost like a lockdown. 

This fat accumulation can happen over a decade. So dissolving it will take a while.

fwkpx7n,Khaetra,2020-07-01 5:00,"I promise you can eat more than celery and cucumbers!  You can even have wings :).

First off, you didn't do this to yourself.  There are large people who can eat dozens of donuts and drink gallons of soda a day and never get it, while there are folks like myself who are skinny, eat right and will.  Bad draw of the genes and do not blame yourself.

Now, first thing you'll need is a blood glucose monitor.  This is a need, as you'll use it many times a day to check what your blood sugar levels are and to see which foods do what  to you.  There are many of them on the market and two that folks use regularly here are the Freestyle and Relion.  The Relion is a Walmart branded meter and people like it because the strips (the expensive part) are pretty cheap.  Most insurance companies do not cover this expense so if you're having to watch your budget, this is the way to go.

Second, get yourself a cheap notebook to start recording your readings and your food.  In the beginning you'll be testing a lot, so having a written record not only tracks your progress but also give you an idea of what's safe to eat (baked chicken with broccoli) and what's not (a sandwich).  The best way to do this is the Test-Eat-Test method.  Test right before you take your first bite and record that number, eat, then test 2 hours afterward.  A small spike is okay (in my case that would be, say, going from 130 to 135/140).  A large spike means that food is off the menu permanently.  Sadly you'll find most of your favorites, like fries, pizza, pasta, bread, rice, etc. you won't be able to have.

Third, the food.  I still grapple and get pretty damn depressed over it.  Many of us do.  This disease sucks and you will feel it, especially around special occasions (no birthday cake) and holidays (all of the Thanksgiving pies, stuffings, potatoes...gone).  It is okay to mourn, be angry, cry...whatever.  Having to change what you eat overnight, not because you want to but because you have to, is a huge shock.

There are plenty of T2 individuals who were never overweight yet it's in their family and they have T2.  I can think of one celebrity (Tom Hanks) but there are others I'm sure.  

It would not surprise me if the underlying metabolic disorder itself contributes to the weight and appetite problem that you have experienced.   They are real and not just your fault.  

The no-carb and/or keto approach to diet will help your T2 and, with some time, I predict that you'll find yourself more satiated and less hungry.   I believe it's the only diet that will work for T2 - though not all doctors are fully behind it.

fwkvyzz,thespicyroot,2020-07-01 6:11,"(M/46).  Diagnosed Spring 2019.  You can do this, but there is a learning curve and some good health habits you will need to adopt ASAP.  The sooner you can get into the rhythm of eating better and some exercise the  easier your transition will be.  Search online for delicious recipes for diabetes patients and learn about this disease.  The learning helped me cope and more importantly, comprehend why I had to make changes.  

I was, and still am, a big beer fan though now I drink for taste and in small quantities.  When I was diagnosed, I only drank water and teas for a few months to clean up my diet and only included lean meats, alot of fish and tons of veggies.  All the goodie food like pasta and pizza went away.  For business lunches, most of my colleagues and team would eat salads with me, though they would eat something tasty after lunch when I was out of sight. God bless their kind hearts. 

While you donâ€™t have to eat like a rabbit (Cukes and celery), become cognizant of what you ingest and drink.  Eventually, once things settle and you get a handle on your glucose levels, you can go back to eating tasty food.  Now, I can enjoy my favorite pizza and pasta, and of course beer!  But in controlled quantities.

Good health to you! You",Topic 1,20-Jul,noncovid,/r/diabetes_t2/comments/hj7kv0/newly_diagnosed_and_full_of_food_fear_and_shame/fwkvyzz/,0

fwkydj2,Kevlar5427,2020-07-01 6:35,"First of all, stop worrying about everyone else. For the most part, I find that almost no one is watching you eat a hamburger and thinking how shameful the fat person is. I find people are far too busy thinking about themselves, so don't worry about them. (And the few who may think that, are certainly not your friends). Don't worry about them. They don't know you, have no clue about your dietary needs or medical history, how much or how hard you are working on your condition, whether today is your birthday so you're treating yourself to a burger, or perhaps you've just *lost* 200 pounds and this is a celebration. Pay no attention to uninformed onlookers. 

Instead, worry about yourself. Which, clearly, you have already started. Get yourself a team. You have a doctor. Get yourself a dietician to teach you about food, what is good and what is bad. You need to learn about food. Start looking at labels. What has sugar in it? (You'll be surprised at what, and *how much*!) You will get used to it. I am amazed at some of the things I used to eat which now I won't touch! and have no urge/desire for either. I just look at them and.... ugh. no!

Mostly. Don't get discouraged, this will take some work. Ask your friends to help you, maybe exercise with you and encourage you to be more active. Or when you go out to eat, go to someplace healthy instead of Micky D's. There are other places, healthy choices. 

And as you already know, you can always come here. There are more than enough people to talk you back up and help. A lot of us have been exactly where you are. You have nothing to be ashamed of.",Topic 3,20-Jul,noncovid,/r/diabetes_t2/comments/hj7kv0/newly_diagnosed_and_full_of_food_fear_and_shame/fwkydj2/,0
fwl0l5q,Woffles92,2020-07-01 6:57,"Recent diagnosis (September 2019) and similar age (28) with also a history on my mums side. 

Firstly - donâ€™t blame yourself. Maybe it was our fault, maybe its family, maybe its both but its happened, its shitty and blaming ourselves wonâ€™t make it go away so it just makes us feel worse for no reason.

Two - you can certainly look into Keto but Iâ€™ve seen a very toxic side of diabetes &amp; keto where youâ€™re looked on as a failure if you so much as think about a carb. It may be that even with a low carb diet you find it difficult to control levels and may have to do full Keto but donâ€™t dive in that end of the pool before you have to...

Three - prepare to have a rough few months. I was miserable for the first couple of months, felt hungry and angry all the time. â€œYes Iâ€™m overweight and eat more than I should but I see skinny people with diets 2 or 3 times worse than mine with no side effects so why did I get struck with this?â€ Thats where my head was at. In the beginning I cut back on a lot of things. Drastically reduced simple carbs (switched were possible to complex versions, brown breads/pastas/rices) and cut carb portion sizes. I cut out all desserts/snacks etc and my treats were fruit and some non-sugared cream. I kept the cheese, and arguably increased it so if youâ€™re anything like me donâ€™t panic about having to give up cheese! Protein is your friend. Meat and cheese kept me going in those first few months!

Three - If youâ€™re able to take meds, do so. Iâ€™m in UK so get Metformin as part of the health service. It gave me digestive issues for a few weeks but I rode it out and it really helped bring my levels down. Theres a sub-culture here that thinks taking meds is a â€œlazyâ€ way to be a diabetic but donâ€™t let that side of Reddit get to you. 

Four - Activity. The more active you are, the less drastic youâ€™ll have to be with your diet. If youâ€™re using up the sugar in your body then its not a around to cause a problem! Iâ€™m not saying run out and join a gym (especially not right now!) but walk more if you can, again start slow and work your way up. I had a pretty active job pre-COVID where I was on my feet all day (teacher) and now Iâ€™m stuck on my computer so have had to find other ways to be active (started jogging once a week and bought an exercise bike). I absolutely hate it but I find it more tolerable than cutting back further than diet.

Iâ€™ve gotten to the point where Iâ€™ve got a nice balance between a diet that is not exactly what I want, but I still enjoy food. I still have occasional take out, I still have treats, just not as frequently as before. Now that Iâ€™ve adjusted to meds and gotten more active Iâ€™ve been able to relax my diet a bit without seeing an increase in my levels. 

You got this. And Iâ€™m happy for you to msg me if you need any more advice / a listening ear :)",Topic 2,20-Jul,noncovid,/r/diabetes_t2/comments/hj7kv0/newly_diagnosed_and_full_of_food_fear_and_shame/fwl0l5q/,0

fwl156x,hrdmad,2020-07-01 7:02,"a newbie - here is my standard newbie line.

1 - take a deep breath, it took a long time to get diabetes, it takes a long time to kill you, it will not kill you this week. 

2 - Take some time to process and learn, you will see things differently in a week or so

3 - Know that there is a thought that obesity is a side effect of diabetes, not the other way around. I.e. being fat does not give you diabetes, but having diabetes can make you fat.

4 - Diet can be very effective at managing type 2 - and what that means is basically, do not eat too many carbs. Look into LOW CARB and Intermittent Fasting. It is not uncommon to get your blood sugar in line within 1-2 months.

5 - Consider a CGM if you can get one, full time monitoring of blood sugar is invaluable in the early days

6 - Look up Jason Fung on Youtube

7 - Read the following - The Diabetes Code (and The Obesity Code) by Fung. Eat Rich Live Long by Cummins

&amp;#x200B;

For me this DX was a blessing in disguise, i changed my diet, lost some weight (15%), lowered my BP, fixed my cholesterol and am managing Type 2 buy diet alone. I went from unknowing fat diabetic with bad cholesterol numbers and high blood pressure with a 30% chance of a heart attack in the next 10 years to a knowing diabetic with good cholesterol and low blood pressure who does the best not to overeat flour sugar etc. while maintaining blood sugar levels in the normal range.",Topic 9,20-Jul,noncovid,/r/diabetes_t2/comments/hj7kv0/newly_diagnosed_and_full_of_food_fear_and_shame/fwl156x/,0

fwl43jz,ravenseyes,2020-07-01 7:29,"Diabetes psychologist here giving some friendly advice (not a professional consultation). I agree with what others have said. This isn't your fault. It sounds like there is a strong hereditary influence of diabetes in your family.  Also, we know that weight isn't the only thing that leads to diabetes. I'm not sure what country you're from, but I can tell you 60% of Americans are overweight or obese and about 10% have diabetes. So, there's obviously some other causes at play.

You've already done something very important in addressing your concerns, which is to reach out to the diabetes community. You are not alone in your feelings or experiences, so it's good to talk to others who have been through this.

There's a great book on what to eat and developing a healthy relationship with food called ""Eat What You Love, Love What You Eat with Diabetes"" by Michelle May. If you want to talk to a professional about what you're going through a psychologist who specializes in diabetes or behavioral medicine would be a good option. What you're going through is so common that the ADA recommends seeing a psychologist as a routine part of diabetes care, though that has yet to be implemented in most places.

fwlns5t,marshmallowmoonchild,2020-07-01 10:10,"Hello! I was diagnosed before my 29th birthday on February 4th this year! Itâ€™s likely Iâ€™ve had diabetes for a few years before this (I ignored symptoms stupidly and just thought I was just a very committed hydrohomie lmao!) I wouldnâ€™t have even known if I hadnâ€™t gone in the hospital for decompression bc of my anxiety, my a1c was 10 and I immediately had several panic attacks and my dad found me lying on the floor crying that I only had 20 or so years left to live (dramatic I know!)  I found out my estranged family has several diabetics in it, this is genetic, some people overweight donâ€™t get it at all and some get it even when theyâ€™re still in the high 100s so donâ€™t beat yourself up

Youâ€™ll feel ashamed and fearful for a bit but what you need is radical acceptance now. You have it, it sucks, youâ€™re gonna survive though! With how many low carb and keto options there are out there youâ€™re going to get a handle on this and live a healthy long life! 

I just got my a1c done last week and Iâ€™m down to a 5.0! Iâ€™m off my medications and managing with only diet and exercise! 

Youâ€™re allowed to feel what youâ€™re feeling but donâ€™t let it rob you of your chance to get well! You have this, you have the will power and the strength! You just have to access it! What helped me was joining the diabetes discord and finding people who were managing as best they could as well! You need support now and people always do better when they encourage each other!

And please, there is keto ice cream out there and low carb breads, you do not have to survive on celery and sparkling water! Donâ€™t be silly! You will enjoy eggs a lot more knowing they wonâ€™t hurt your bg just telling you that! And you can have porkrinds for crunchy snacking! You can even make keto cheesecakes! Itâ€™s all about adapting!

fwm1wbk,Dragon-Accountant,2020-07-01 11:56,"As someone else who had a similar mental break when I was diagnosed about 4 months ago, you can eat more than sparkling water and air. 

I (26/F) was devastated when I was diagnosed. I had an A1C of 6.9% and skipped past Prediabetes into T2. I was terrified to even tell my parents because my Dad was rather negative me regarding how much I ate throughout growing up. 

I focused on trying to eat less carbs (not full keto, but simple replacements like something other than fries or getting burrito bowls instead of burritos) as well as just trying to eat smaller portions. I counted calories best I could with MyFitnessPal (free version) and allowed myself some cheat days throughout. Cutting food off and heavily drawing back is not sustainable. Slowly lowering your portions and staying under your daily calorie amount is slow and steady. Iâ€™ve lost 20 lbs since then and was able to pull my A1c back down to 6.3% in the prediabetes range.

Itâ€™s not easy, but I tried to channel that fear into motivation. Iâ€™ve been heavy as long as I can remember, was bullied plenty for it in school, and even had some side eye glances from my Dad. But Iâ€™m moving towards more sustainable for sure. Honestly, most of the time (especially with covid) Iâ€™ve been living off freezer foods and just making sure to count them. I have four items usually (corn dogs, taquitos, chicken melts, and fish sticks) that Iâ€™ll mix and match for a meal to be around 600-700 calories. I usually also end up skipping either breakfast or dinner cuz Iâ€™ll be distracted by video games or chatting online with friends, in kind of a casual intermittent fasting way. Some days I do awesome and only felt hungry enough for 1,200ish calories. Some days I go over my calorie count and feel a bit bad, but acknowledge it and move on. On average, Iâ€™ll have about 1500-1800 calories and do pretty good. And I definitely look for the wins - both on and off the scale. 

I very much believe in you. I understand how you feel, but from someone who also has an anorexic sister, cutting off all food is not the answer. And honestly, slowly cutting back portions surprisingly does make your stomach shrink a decent amount. My bf has also been trying to lose weight and when we have a cheat date night we both find we canâ€™t eat as much as before. So it will get easier slowly but surely.",Topic 1,20-Jul,noncovid,/r/diabetes_t2/comments/hj7kv0/newly_diagnosed_and_full_of_food_fear_and_shame/fwm1wbk/,0

\- if you are not testing your blood sugar multiple times a day, you should, it tells you what your food is doing to your sugar

\- you are being to hard on yourself, estimates are up to 50% of population has preD or D.

\-do some research on diabetes, you don't die from it, until you lose some toes, a foot, perhaps your sight, then you die. That sounds like shit.

i am like you, 59 in 2 days, DX with diabetes after seeing doc for something else, live in a house where pizza, chips, bread, takeout, sugar drinks are and were common.

My diet now is high in meat (not the lean stuff), many different cheeses, high fat creams, no white stuff (flour sugar), no food from a box, no fast food.

Monitor blood sugar 24/7.

&amp;#x200B;

12 months ago, i was 260#, diabetic levels.

Now i am down 40#, blood pressure fixed, cholesterol fixed, blood sugar fixed, cognizant of the fact once a diabetic, always.

&amp;#x200B;

Consider PreD a wake up call, your opportunity to make changes that do not need to be drastic in your case, but without the changes, you will need to make those changes in the future as D progresses

&amp;#x200B;

the book ""Eat Rich Live Long"" by cummins and gerber offered plenty of food type i would rather eat than what i was eating previously, crappy frozen pizza as an example.

Now I'm not a doctor, but If you're already on insulin, then your sugars should be good already. Instead just adjust the insulin you're taking (IE: Reduce). Ideally you'd want a high protein meal post work out, so just coffee is fine. The caffeine will give you a nice pre-workout boost (that's all most pre-workout is anyway). 

The antioxidants in coffee are quite good for you. The trick is, don't add ANY sugar. Cut the cream too if you can. Ideally you're just drinking it black. Coffee by itself is quite good, it's all the shit people add that make it a disaster.

At any rate, the real key is to test your BG when you try new activities that you're not sure how they'll affect your BG. This will generally mean testing more often than you'd like, but after you start to get a good idea of how your body works you won't really need to do it near as often.

An average workout burns only a couple hundred calories. Your servings of fruit are probably replacing the calories you are burning. Burning calories isn't the only goal of exercise, but you shouldn't be eating extra unless you know you need it. 

Being diabetic isn't usually about avoiding low blood sugar, it's about fighting high blood sugar. If you're worried about low blood sugar, check your blood sugar before a workout and keep glucose tablets and a protein bar with you.

My desire is to do diet, and liife mod, and drugs as the last resort. I tried Metformin early in the year and it gave me guesome palpitations and landed me in the ER thinking i was having a heart attack.   My body just couldn't tolerate it. So asopposed to going onto the next level of meds, my doc and i agreed to let me try really going after diet and lifesyle changes. And then Corona virus hit...

But anyway I cut carbs, started intermittent fasting and started taking Berberine. Which worked very well for me. It tatses terrible, but was worth it.  (I can't swallow pills so I open capsules and just dump 'em in my mouth). I did 500mg 3x/day. And  my numbers really improved!! i was at 252  my last doc visit, and i can down to about consistently in the 150's range.

I had heard you should ""cycle"" taking supplements so after about 9 weeks of Berberine, I gave Ashwagandha a try. I use a liquid form, just a dropper in two ounces of liquid. It really worke well for me, and no louse taste. And the really grear thing is that for me, the Ashwagandha had a tremendous stress-relieving effect. And i also a lot of weight,  went from love 160's to low 140's and even to 138 yesterday. Now, I also became more strict with my diet â€“ only meat and vegggies, but I do slip every now and then, and I also have a piece of dark chocolate daily and will sometimes have berries with whipped cream in the evening. I also use minkfruit sweetener.

But I swear by Ashwagandha! I belive the weight loss was the result of the calming effect of Ashwagandha reducing my stress, and therefore my cortisol and made it possible for me to shed the pounds. My numbers tend to be a little high first thing in the morning â€“ 120's generally â€“ but then I settle down to the low 100's, and since I'm doing intermittent fasting I usualy let myself get to the low 90's before I eat.

I think it's very important to try to have a few hours between you last forkful/spoonful and goiing to bed.

But Ashwagandaha has really worked for me. I know everryone is different and everyone should consult their doctor. I haven't been back to my doc for an A1C dur to the pandemic, but I would expect it would show a huge improvement over the 8.1 I had my last visit. (And also, I'm pretty sedentary.

I knew that some of them would judge me because I'd been overweight for years. I decided to wait so that I could get my numbers in range and educate myself before the inevitable questions came up. No one of that side of my family had it so it was completely foreign to them. When I told them, I didn't make a huge deal about it. I told them that I had been diagnosed several months ago, I had been taking my doctor's advice and my numbers were great. I still get comments my from grandparents like, ""should you be eating that?"" and "" I just can't believe you have to give yourself shots!"". Yeah, it annoys me, but at least I'm not as emotional as I was back when I was first diagnosed. 

On the other hand, I did tell a cousin of mine on my mother's side. He is T1 and manages it very well. He was super supportive, gave me tips and recipe ideas. He kept it under his hat while I pulled myself together. I'm so grateful for his support!

I would tell you that it depends on your family. Would anyone be supportive? If so, it may be helpful to expand your support system. But if you feel that they might stress you out more I'd say there is no reason to tell them right away.

fymkz3v,Robbie_the_Brave,2020-07-19 21:02,"My mother is type 2 diabetic with COPD. She actually tested positive for the COVID antibodies, but never noticed any symptoms. She tested negative for an active infection, so she survived it with no repercussions. She is still afraid to go out in public out of fear she could get it again, but I have not heard of anybody who got it, healed from it to the point of testing negative for an active infection twice 2 weeks apart (protocol in my area) who got it again. I am hoping that it stays that way for her.

The same thing was true for my siblings minus the preexisting health conditions... No symptoms and over it before they were tested. Since my mother and I cared for my sister's children while she worked at a nursing home, my family was tested and we are all negative for the antibodies meaning we have never had COVID. The local health department tested all of the patients in the nursing home my sister works at and all of the residents were negative for an active infection. They did not do an antibody test.

It seems like there are some factors that make COVID awful for some, but not for others. I think it will be years before we really know. The best any of us can do is take precautions, but try not to worry about things that we cannot control. So long as you are taking precautions anyways, the fear and stress can adversely affect your health otherwise. My doc has even said that high stress can increase blood sugar levels.

fymsf74,BasqueOne,2020-07-19 22:37,"T2, under control with diet and exercise, 67 years old. Like you, I was anxious about contracting covid19. Full on paranoia hit when I had a slight cough at end of April, and on April 29 began to feel off. Headache, body aches and generally feeling bad up to mid-May. Then headaches disappeared. and occasional chills &amp; deep fatigue really hit. This continued to mid-June, so about 50 days total. At the end, I'd have 1 day good then two days bad and that went on for 2+ weeks. The cyclic nature of this virus had me quite depressed for several weeks. You just can't predict it.

I never had a respiratory problem, never had a fever or elevated temp. I did a major vitamin regimen, VD, Zinc, VC, VA and Tylenol for body aches. Any sugar messed me up completely. The virus just thrives on sugar. 

Covid19 messed up my sleep and it continues to be disrupted and I've noticed it affects my mood.  I have to be careful not to get too tired or too hungry, but otherwise doing quite well.  I was deeply fortunate to have a mild case, but having my blood sugar under control made me feel more confident.  Most people that contract it do not have major complications so don't assume that you will.  

Do focus on controlling the things that you can: socially distance, wear a mask, wash hands frequently, eat and exercise to maintain health. I was a maniac before I got the virus so I cooked and froze meals to last for 6 weeks and I'm so glad I did. It was something I could control and when I was too tired to even pick up a cup, I could have a good meal. Now that I feel better, I'm busy cooking and filling the freezer again.

hug3he,crazymessytheorist,2020-07-19 23:03,"Hi , this post is for my mother who is 66 and newly detected. Her sugar tends to remain around 170/180. I am still very new to all this and reading up as much as I can. She has been taking 500 mg metformin for last 6 months but it has not brought her sugar levels down even one bit. She was asked to add a night dose of same meds 500 mg but after 15 days of taking this, her blood work is the same. In fact to my surprise, as soon as she started taking Fenugreek water( after being recommended by some friends of her ) , it magically dropped 40/50 points. Apparently some of these herbal remedies work very well at pre diabetic stage. As a next step I tried to take her off her meds and it continued to come at a lower range ( between 100-140) . I would like to know , is it possible that metformin does not work on everyone ? Or is it that 1000 mg a day is too low ? Should I be asking the doctor to change her meds to something else ?

fyojv06,TheWolfAndRaven,2020-07-20 11:07,"The goal is to keep your sugar under 140. That's about the point where long term complication risks become minimal. Lower is better. UNDER 70 is the opposite end and EVEN MORE dangerous - as you can go into a diabetic coma quick. If you're under 70 you may act drunk and hurt yourself - especially if you're driving or operating machinery. 

It is unlikely to happen at the start, but it IS something to be aware of. 

A Non-diabetic will typically test around 80-90 fasted. Post meal they're unlikely to test over 120-140 and will quickly resume to the baseline below 100. 

In regards to Blood sugar, the biggest factor will be the number of carbs you eat. So if you're going to track any macros, that's the one to monitor. Different types of carbs effect you differently, but the total number is the easiest to track for simplicity sake. 

How many you have is a personal thing and you'll have to trial and error it to figure it out. It all depends on your body, how much insulin you produce and how insulin resistant your body is. This is an ever-changing moving target, but the target moves slow. IF you control your diabetes it should improve and start to level out and you'll be able to enjoy a little more carbs from time to time.  

My dad can have the old ADA recommended amount of ~45g per meal. I personally can only have around 20-30g before I spike over 140. 

In regards to BG, diet is probably 80% of the battle. Activity level is secondary though it seems like you're doing great there. Losing fat will help reduce insulin resistance, as will gaining lean muscle mass.

One last note, pick up a copy of Dr Bernstein's Diabetes Solution. It's a field manual for the diabetic and can answer every single question you could ever have about diabetes (both type 1 and type 2). It's very worth having a copy in your house as reference.",Topic 10,20-Jul,noncovid,/r/diabetes_t2/comments/hulfsq/newly_diagnosed_type_2_questions/fyojv06/,0

What this means is that you should see a lowered BG number. 

The main problem with alcohol is that you can drink enough and put your blood sugar TOO low, but you'll be too drunk to notice and the drunken state will hid the side-effects of a hypoglycemia (low sugar) episode. This could lead to a diabetic coma or even death on the heavy end. On the light side you might fall and injure yourself.

From a glucose stand point, one drink a day is probably fine. From a long-term health stand point, I would question it. Diabetes is disease that stems from a messed up metabolic system.

If your pancreas is not fully functioning, yet heavy alcohol use is associated with pancreatitis, and fatty liver (typically an alcoholicâ€™s diagnosis) is a big risk factor for Type 2 diabetics, I think itâ€™s fair to say that it doesnâ€™t take much logic to conclude that alcohol is hard on the same systems that are already showing reduced functionality at great risk to your health. I cannot believe that itâ€™s OK to have alcohol barely at all, separate from the question of how it affects sugar levels, if youâ€™re Type 2. I really think this condition is a long game where the  goal is to give your body a break by eating well and being fit and supporting how it functions; thereâ€™s no way alcohol fits cleanly in that equation. I think a lot of us are a bit delusional about this for the obvious reasons. I donâ€™t know of studies that say â€œdonâ€™t drink alcoholâ€ but I could be wrong.

Hereâ€™s a question: are there any Type 2 diabetics who have been around for 25 years, who have been drinking alcohol but not seen their medication needs progress? Seems like there are people around here who have fully controlled their condition without advancing to more or different meds, but I donâ€™t think theyâ€™ve been alcohol drinkers.

i604p9,allmaechd,2020-08-08 7:36,"Hello everyone,

at the end of April/start of May I went to my general practitioner for a regular checkup (35F).

Everything went well during the appointment (despite the general corona-madness); my doctor told me to call in a few days, as she did not expect any problems.

Well, when I called a few days later, they told me that my fasting blood sugar was at 120 when it should be no more than 100. The next day, they took another blood sample and told me to call again. At this point they were still convinced that I was not properly fasting the first time.   
This time, my number was 109; the long-time sugar however was ""inconspicious"" according to my docter (I forgot to ask her the exact number - to be honest I was quite surprised and overwhelmed by the whole situation).

My father was diabetic - however, until now I hadn't really realized that diabetes has a genetic component. I attributed my fathers diabetes to his admittedly shitty lifestyle-choices (he was an alcoholic, wasn't really compliant when taking his medication and refused to get insulin shots because he ""didn't like needles"".).

My docter knows about my fathers diabetes. While she is a general practitioner, she also has a specialization in diabetes and is participating in my countrys disease management program for diabetes; this makes me feel ""safe"" on this part.

She told me to come back every six months as she thinks my whole situation is ""in need of control"".

At this time I was slightly overweight, so she told me to loose ""maybe 3-4 kg if you can manage it"" (6-9 lbs).

In the 3 months since this appointment I have lost 8 kg (17,5lbs).

I immediately bought a glucose meter and some test stripes.

I went on a low carb diet. I have been testing my bodies reaction to different types of food in order to find out what works for me and what is problematic.

I went on the internet in order to find out how to prevent a progression to full blown diabetes - you seem like great guys and gals here, but I would rather not join the club.

And this is where I am not sure what to do.

The most common advice on the internet is:

\- loose weight

\- don't drink soda

\- don't eat sweets

\- more physical activity

\- change your diet

Concerning the weight loss: I have already done this. I have lost double of what my docter asked me to loose. I am at 67 kg/148lbs, with a BMI of 23. My ""at-home-readings"" have remained unchanged.

Concerning the soda: I don't drink coke/soda etc. I only drink water and freshly brewn peppermint tea (without sugar). I have been doing it this way all of my life.

Concerning the sweets: I never had a sweet tooth. I normally stick to dark chocolate (more than 90%) anyway and have been doing so for years. 

Concerning the physical activity: Admittedly, I work an office job. Before corona I have been to the gym 2-3 times a week. I havent been to the gym since february, however I tried to substitute this with going on long walks (think 2-3 hours). At normal days (without going for a walk) I will avarage about 8000 steps per day. Is this too little? Should I do more physical acitivity? Is cardio preferable or am I fine with using the weight-training-machines at the gym (I really hate cardio. Was never able to get into running).

Concerning the diet change: This is the point where everything got very confusing for me, and I have so many questions...  
\- Is the recommended diet needed to prevent diabetes different from the diet that diabetic people should follow?  
\- From what I've read, carbs lead to spikes in blood sugar. Spikes in blood sugar = bad. However, my country still recommends filling one quarter of a plate with carbs (rice, noodles, potatoes). This seems contradictory.  
\- My country also recommends eating wholegrain pasta instead of regular ""white"" pasta. Is wholegrain pasta safe to eat - or would it be even better not to eat pasta at all?

Personally, I have never been a fan of pasta, rice and potatoes. I do like their taste - but I have noticed for all my life that I gain weight very quickly when I eat carb heavy meals. I have been on a carb reduced diet for quite a while. However, I had planed to transition to a plant based diet. This seems to be a bad idea with Prediabetes, doesn't it?

Since the doctor appointment I stick to: eggs, skyr, lentils, salads (leafy greens, carrots, bell pepper, onions, tomatoes, olives, nuts), broccoli, cauliflower (and lots of other vegetables like zucchini, aubergine...), lamb, chicken, tofu, stremel-salmon and cottage cheese. I was hesitant to introduce the lentils at first, but they work well for my blood sugar. Sadly I am lactose intolerant so I have to be careful with the cheese (although some belly pain is preferable to diabetes). I tried to eat rice three times - this did not go well. I did this explicitly to test my reaction to rice. The first time I had rice with vegetables. Went from 99 to 180 in 1,5 hours. Tried it again a month later, had rice with vegetables and went from 92 to 176 in one hour, was at 182 after two hours, at 174 at 2,5 hours and back to 94 after 3 hours. Is this a ""bad sign"" that is pointing to diabetes or could this happen to a ""normal"" person, too?

As long as i stick to this, everything seems to be fine. I start in the 100s before eating, and after 1-2 hours I get no higher than in the 110s, 120s. Would a ""normal"" person have different readings?

However, there are three things I do not understand:

\- a lot of the time, my blood sugar is lower after I eat than it was before the meal. How is this possible? (started of with 110. Ate a sausage. Was at 102 after 1,5 hours. I understand that the glucose meters are not 100% accurate, but this is a common occurence for me).

\- As long as I eat low carb, I don't really experience any spikes. However, my fasting seems to be subborn and is rarely under 100 - no matter what time of the day, no matter how long I have been fasting (once went 36 hours without eating in order to test this). 

\- In the morning my blood sugar is usually around 120. I do understand that this seems to be called ""dawn phenomenon"". Is this something that ""normal"" people experience, too? Or is this something exclusive to diabetic folks (you might notice that I'm searching for a loophole to get me out of the prediabetic category).

So, yeah, I am kind of confused with this whole stuff - especially the recommendations regarding diet. I would appreciate help.

Is there anything I am missing? Or am I already doing everything and am screwed because of bad genes?

It just seems like I don't have any ""wiggle room"" or room for improvement by changing my lifestyle - because I seem to have been doing most of this stuff subconciously for the past years already.

I would eat my last meal around 8:30 pm and eat my first meal around 12:00pm. I only ate twice a day and I eat &lt;25 carbs a meal. Itâ€™s helped a lot.

If you feel like you get hungry a lot I try to occupy myself by taking longer doing self care or starting on work.




So for lunch I would have meat and a big salad or a meat and egg whites. Then for dinner I would have a meat and any vegetables that my mom makes, mostly green beans. Sometimes it does it pretty boring but trying different sauces and spices helps a lot. I found that I can eat salad if it has onions, a sprinkle of cheese, bacon bits and 2 tbsp of ranch

I have hypothyroidism also so weight loss is kind of hard but Iâ€™ve been losing a few pounds. I have to wait about 30 minutes to an hour to eat so itâ€™s pretty easy.


One thing Iâ€™ve learned to do is when my Dexcom ends I have 1-2 days to eat anything I want but the whole day must be under 100 grams of net carbs . So whatever Iâ€™m craving I can eat but I still check my sugars to make sure I see how high I spike. This might not be suitable for everyone so I would try at your own risk. I only do this up to 3 times a month and I try to aim for 70mg/dl to 150 mg/dl when Iâ€™m on my Dexcom.




Swaps are also the best. I hate most keto foods like almond flour 100% dark chocolate so Iâ€™ve stuck the low carb side. I found that my carb tolerance without spikes is around 30 grams of carbs. I swap ice cream for frozen whipped cream or jello w/ whipped cream and chips for Quest chips. For the 100% dark chocolate I melt the chocolate and add stevia to where I like it.

ic3rh8,mercurialm00n,2020-08-18 9:01,So Iâ€™ll try to keep my story short. I was crying over a hair cut when my boss who is a cardiologist asked if I was okay bc I looked tired. I did not have the heart to tell him what I was actually crying about so I just told him I was exhausted and tired and not sleeping well. He had my blood checked and turns out I am VERY diabetic (i havenâ€™t had my checked since maybe 2011) and a bunch of other stuff. My A1C was 11 and my fasting blood sugar level was 267. Iâ€™m now on metformin and I have changed my diet completely and mainly eat meat and veggies and ride a stationary bike for about 25 mins every day (the last 5 are the cool down) and when i was doing that last week it was lowering my blood sugar just fine. The lowest Iâ€™ve gotten my blood sugar down to was 109. This past Sunday my blood sugar was 111 and but yesterday and this morning even with exercise my blood sugar has been 132 and I cannot figure out why. The only thing I can think of would be a new melatonin Iâ€™m taking bc the first ingredient has mannitol and thereâ€™s also some sucralose i think. Has anyone ever had artificial sweeteners raise their blood sugar levels?? My dad (who is also t2) said they donâ€™t but thatâ€™s literally the only thing i can think of that has recently changed/been added into my diet.,Topic 7,20-Aug,noncovid,/r/diabetes_t2/comments/ic3rh8/newly_diagnosed_diabetic_here_w_some_questions/,Newly diagnosed diabetic here w some questions

Sometimes stress or exercise can spike it. People on here have mentioned that low grade infections or illness can effect their numbers. If it's a one time thing, I wouldn't worry about it too much. If it's a trend, look into what you're eating. Diet soda doesn't effect me but results can vary. If you're worried about anything you're eating, test your sugar before eating, and then take it again an hour or two later to see just how much it spiked. 

When you say your sugar was higher in the morning, do you mean your fasting sugar aka before you eat breakfast? You might be getting the dawn effect, which is pretty common. TL;dr when you wake up your liver decides to give you energy for the day by pumping out extra sugar. Fun!

I have been Low Carb since daignosis (with some periods of non-compliance).  I have decided to get really serious recently and know that i can lose weight with fasting, but I am also concerned that at my age, I am sarcopenic (muscle loss, my scale says 25% muscle, 49% fat).  I can't decide if i should follow a strict fasting schedule (including extended multi-day fasts) to burn this fat, knowing i will lose LBM, or should I eat more protein and ramp up the weight training to try an increase my LBM, and not lose fat as quickly.  Is the problem more viceral / liver fat, or lack of muscle mass (to absorb glucose)?

My morning fasting glucose is typically \~ 130.  I am WFH so I have a very flexible schedule, but I'm so paralyzed by trying to decide what to do (fasting/light exercise vs. protein and strength training) i end up doing neither and i have plateaued my weight loss.  Alternative three would be a strict fasting schedule, with strength training, to burn fat (manage insulin, etc) and try to maintain LBM, which would be a good compromise.  But as you might know, resistance training fasted is not great and hard to sustain, but then again, neither is kidney failure or a stroke.  

I'm just sick of tying myself into knots over this and would appreciate some advice.  I am a pretty disciplined guy (have already lost about 100 lbs) but the paralysis and fear of doing ""the wrong thing"" is making me crazy.

I was given a finger-prick testing machine which was taken off me about 2 years ago, and had test strips on prescription, which have gone as well.  I even had a nurse ask me whether I tested regularly, and didnâ€™t know that I didnâ€™t have a machine, from the same practice that took it off me.

When I get my yearly tests done, I used to have a GP review afterwards, but that stopped and I just got a letter sent to me with the numbers (useless to a lot of people; thankfully I used to work on Diabetes stats for the NHS, so I have some idea of what they mean).  Recently even the letter has stopped, and they expect me to call and just speak to one of the assistants, or rely on someone calling me if something is bad.

It really is a shambles, but I will say that I think part of it is the GP surgery youâ€™re at.  Effective diabetic care is tying a whole bunch of services and information together, and it requires a good GP practice to do that.

If your current practice isnâ€™t good at that, then find another to register with, and ask if they have practitioners who specialise in diabetes.

Donâ€™t lose hope though; my readings have been up and down over the last 10 years, and lockdown/COVID has really knocked me back as my healthier routine was turned on itâ€™s head.

itrs8d,allmaechd,2020-09-16 1:41,"Hello everyone,

I'm not sure how to deal with lunch at work and am looking for advice.
As long as I prepare my own food at home, everything is alright - I count my carbs and calories and my blood sugar stays within an acceptable range. I have been working from home since March, so this has worked quite nicely for me.
However, I am now gradually returning to the office.
We do have a staff restaurant... And it is not Low carb friendly. We get to choose between two dishes, and both always include some carb-heavy component either as a side or as the main ingredient. Choosing between pasta and currywurst with a side of fries does not feel good (in this case, I took the later and ate only the sausage - but this leaves me hungry).

Pre-Corona (and before this diabetes crap) I sometimes brought my own food. However, I commute by public transportation. I got my laptop Case in the left hand, mobile phone in the right, (heavy) purse on my right shoulder, all while wearing a mask and trying to keep the distance.
To be honest, I don't know how to comfortable transport yet another thing (my lunchbox). Commuting takes around 45-60 minutes, so it's a total of 1,5-2 hours (I am standing most of the time as there are both enough seats for all of the commuters).
At work there is only one microwave, so I will spend a good deal of my break waiting for coworkers to finish heating their lunch.

Any advice?
How do you deal with staff restaurants/cateens/cafeterias? (And by the way, which is the correct term/what is the difference? I am a non-native speaker.)

Not your current BS.


You still have diabetes and you still need to take the medication as prescribed. 


Do not stop any medication unless your doctor tells you to. 


Have you called the doctor to let them know you're not taking the other medicine?

You're trying to say that if anyone, who is a diabetic, has a good blood sugar reading once or twice that it means they are automatically no longer a diabetic?

Your red blood cells generally don't live for more than 3 months, so if you wait that long between blood tests then most of your cells are new, and so if your blood sugar remains low as it has been since starting metformin your next blood test in 3 months will likely be much lower. This doesn't negate the fact that your previous 3 months have seen excessive glucose in your system. Those meds work very quickly and I assume you're also eating better.

Or medication that you think you do not need.



At least? That's what it sounds like. 



As if you know more about diabetes than your doctor does. 



And that's not good. 



I have had diabetes all of my life and I still don't know everything about it. I am still learning new things about my diabetes everyday.


As your doctor already knows? 



Diabetes needs to be *treated* aggressively. That is why he started you on the medication he prescribed.


You really should not be second-guessing your doctor (a person who went to medical school) in regards to your diabetes. 



You are not the first person that they have treated that has diabetes. I'm pretty sure they know what they're doing.


I'm a diabetic and I still have a safe amount of carbs in my diet. I don't know who told you to cut carbs out 100%?


&gt;People withÂ diabetesÂ who take insulin or another blood-sugar-lowering medicationÂ couldÂ experience life-threatening low blood sugar levels if theyÂ cut carbsÂ without adjusting their medication and checking their blood sugar frequently.


I've been a diabetic most of my life. I have never cut out carbs 100%. 



Certainly? 



My doctor has never told me to cut out carbs 100%.


&gt;They do affect your blood sugar levels, which is why you'll need to keep up with how many you eat each day. Some carbs have vitamins, minerals, and fiber. So choose those ones, such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables


Taking more than one type of medication for diabetes is normal nowadays. 


Personally? I currently take one type of insulin and a shot similar to what you take. I take Humulin RU 500 in the morning and at night, and I take Victoza in the morning.


I have a friend that takes two different types of insulin, a shot similar to what you take, and Metformin.


A lot of people take Metformin, insulin (sometimes more than one), and other types of medicine (in various combinations) to keep their diabetes under control.


Sometimes even more medicines.


As time goes by? Your doctor will try different medicnes in order to keep your diabetes under control. It is quite normal. It is to be expected. 


Diabetes should be treated aggressively. 



It is not something you sweep under the carpet and just hope and pray that it goes away.  Especially if you go and DIY and ignore the advice of your doctor. 



Or try and talk your doctor into not treating your diabetes aggressively.


Or try to bargain with medical professionals when they tell you what you need to do in order to treat the diabetes aggressively. 


Your blood sugars are probably a little better because you are taking some of the medication that your doctor prescribed. However? I'm concerned that you are not taking all of the medicine that he prescribed. Do you know why he prescribed it? It is because diabetes is a disease that needs to be treated aggressively.


Diabetes is not something you take a chance with.


My BS are at a really good level. However? The damage of diabetes marches on. 


Diabetes does not stop. It keeps moving forward in your body.


It is good that your BS is under control. 


Diabetes doesn't really care. 



The damage to your body still continues forward. 


Which is what is happening to me. 


I was always under the impression that if my BS was under control? Then it meant that everything was going to be okay. 


However? 



That is not how diabetes really works.


Diabetes is an autoimmune disease. It is a chronic (long lasting) illnessÂ that affects how your body turns food into energy.


Diabetes infects your entire body. You can try to delay the damage that diabetes will cause. But that's about it.


&gt;Over time, diabetes can affect any part of your body. The good news is that you can prevent or delay many health complications by taking good care of yourself. That includes keeping your blood sugar levels as close to your target as possible, eating healthy, getting regular physical activity, keeping your blood pressure and cholesterol at the levels your doctor sets, taking medicines if needed, and getting regular checkups.


Do what you need to do to make sure the diabetes and its affects stay away from your body for as long as possible. 


Follow the directions of your diabetes doctor.


Also? 


Make an appointment with their nutritionist.


I write down everything that I eat and drink. I use an app called My Fitness Pal. I use the free portion. It tracks my weight, my BS levels, everything I eat and drink, exercise, and so many other things.



Don't give up! 


You've got this!

Advice from someone who has had the injections at 3 different clinics:

* Insist the assistant make absolutely certain your eye(s) are numbed prior to the injection(s). They use drops first but the key is the second anesthetic (I believe it is a form of lidocaine). Require they allow adequate time (15 minutes) to reach full effect.

* Further, after the injection, assure that the assistant completely and thoroughly rinse your eye(s). If they only do a cursory job, your eye(s) will profusely water and sting for hours.

If you follow these guides, the injections are pain free and over in less than a few seconds.  The practice I attend now never fails to offer small vials of *sterile tears* to flush my eye(s) should I ever need the additional care. Fortunately, now that I am in treatment where the physicians and staff are focused more on patients than pocketbook, it is an exceptional experince.

Am I at higher risk just because of my glucose intolerance, or am I not at increased risk if my numbers are pretty much under control?


And am I under control? Here is a snapshot of me and my management:


My most recent a1c was 5.5, down from 6.4 in November, and I have lost about 25 pounds from my 5â€™5 frame (still have about 50 to go to get to my healthy weight, but I am also 4 months pregnant so weight loss/ gain is complicated). Iâ€™ve been resolute with my commitment to managing with a healthy lifestyle since then, except for falling off the low-carb wagon for a couple months at the beginning of the pandemic lockdown. 


I work hard on my diet, have cut out all carbs except for those in non-starchy vegetables. I also exercise with a pretty high intensity for 40 minutes about 4 times per week. I am not on medication, but I am open to it as even with my lifestyle efforts I cannot get my morning fasting blood sugar under 100 (usually about 115, but up to 135 if I miss working out for a few days).

Iâ€™ve been T2 for almost 3 years. 7.8 A1C when diagnosed and since itâ€™s never been over 5.4. Iâ€™m clinically obese and I have high blood pressure and I got covid back in June. This is how it went

* 6/22 - boss tested positive. Went and got tested. Began self quarantine. 
* 6/27 - results came back negative 
* 7/10 - Started feeling symptoms. Mainly loss of taste and smell. 
* 7/11 - loss of smell and taste intensified. Hot flashes. Minor Cough. Body ache. Got tested
* 7/12 - results came back positive. Symptoms persisted. No real temperature. Cough is the same. Headache. Fatigue. Body aches. Sleeping a lot 
* 7/13 - lots of fatigue. Cough acts up when I move around. No smell or taste. Hot flashes. Headache. 
* 7/14 - Headache. Fatigue. Diarrhea. Cough. No smell or taste
* 7/15 - headache. Fatigue. Cough. Diarrhea. No smell. Taste a little 
* 7/16 - headache. Cough. Fatigue. Diarrhea. Video call with the doc. She gave me some cough medicine. It helps. She Also wanted me to take  vitamin C and zinc which Iâ€™ve been doing for a few months. 
* 7/17 - headache. Fatigue. Cough. No smell. Taste is tiny bit better. Nose gets stuffy. 
* 7/18 - headache. Fatigue. Cough is a bit better. Taste is slowly coming back. Sinus congestion is about the same 
* 7/19 - rough night, woke up 3xs covered in sweat, no fever. Have been feeling okay since. Still tired, cough isnâ€™t bad. Overall seem to be on a snails pace of improvement. 

After the 19th I was feeling better daily but it took another 3 weeks for it to leave my system. I was getting tested 3x a week. I had to provide my work with a negative test in order to return to work. So all in all it was pretty mild. The worst of it was probably the digestive part. I strongly suggest anybody especially diabetes start taking Vitamins C&amp;D and Zinc. Itâ€™s a proven immune strengthening cocktail... Clearly everybody is different but this is how it went for me.

g7mii1q,polyurethanewheels,2020-10-03 22:36,"Diabetics make more pyruvate during infections because of accelerated beta-adrenergic activity during the hyper metabolic phase of infection, and that activity is unopposed due to insulin resistance. This means diabetics are more prone to lactic acidosis during infection, the sequelae of which leave them with lower physiological reserves to compensate for haemodynamic changes.

This applies for all infections, not just covid.

If there is an increased incidence for covid amongst diabetics (and I donâ€™t specifically know if there is or isnâ€™t) then it would be my guess that it would be because of increased diagnosis due to generally getting sicker with it than the rest of the population.

TL;DR - metabolism has to interact with the increased physiological demands of infection. Since diabetes is a derangement of metabolism, diabetics can become more sick.",Topic 10,20-Oct,covid,/r/diabetes_t2/comments/j4mr17/is_the_increased_risk_for_covid_related_to_just/g7mii1q/,0

I'm on my seventh weekly dosage of Ozempic and I just moved from .25 to .5 dosage.    Not gonna lie - it's a love/hate relationship.   I'm constipated pretty much all the time - need to take something for that...    I've had 2 nights of vomiting and many(\~50%) days/nights of nausea.    BUT  my bg numbers are way down and I've lost 20lbs despite being less active in the 7 weeks...       I've modified my diet quite a bit to get my stomach happy.   Literally no big meals anymore.    It's a struggle to stay hydrated.     I've found some foods the make the stomach happy/less nausea.   I don't eat as much because of nausea and just not hungry.       You have some good days and some bad days.   I'm hopeful that I'll get used to the 0.5 dosage.  I hope to loose weight and then return to only metformin.

g9j9whg,DovBerele,2020-10-21 5:41,"The sad news about brown rice is that it's almost as glycemic as white rice.  The difference is marginal. 

Psyllium husk is helpful, in slowing down the carbs so they hit your bloodstream more gradually.  Other kinds of soluble fiber, as well as fats, do the same thing. 

The cost issue is real.  It's expensive to eat low-carb, becasue carbs are cheap! I'm so grateful I got diagnosed two years when I was relatively financially stable, rather than six or ten years ago when I was super broke.  There are some low carb foods that are relatively cheaper than others (eggs, canned tuna, tofu) and there are some moderate carb but lower glycemic foods that might work as substitutes which are very cheap (lentils, beans, barley, buckwheat, root vegetables like carrots or turnips, sweet potatoes if they're boiled or steamed but baking/roasting increased the glycemic load). 

There's also a trick that works to lower the glycemic index of potatoes, and pasta.  You cook them fully (in the case of the potatoes, boil or steam, don't bake), then cool them fully in the refrigerator.  You can then eat them cold or reheat them, and some of the starch will have converted to what's called ""resistant starch"" which is better for blood sugar.  The same thing works, to a degree, with sourdough or whole grain bread.  Slice it and put it in the freezer, then toast it when it comes out of the freezer.

You need to track your blood sugar before and after meals and understand what causes your bg to spike. Itâ€™s generally the same for everyone but different people tolerate different foods differently. 

The biggest thing you need to do is cut your carb intake at each meal. Get it down to 75gm a meal and see how you feel. If itâ€™s still causing highs, try 50gms a meal

jn1oev,bakedzini,2020-11-02 18:06,"Hi guys! Im coming to reddit to maybe get some insight and advice about myself. I am a 20 year old female, 5'5"" and about ~160 lbs. When i was around 14 i started having bad circulation issues in my legs. My blood was not being transported fast enough and my legs would get super red if i walked around and they felt tight and sore. During this time i also developed some dark spots (bigger than freckles) around my chin and mouth. My mom worried about diabetes (it runs in her family). These have since gone away but i still have the leg issue on a weekly basis. Fast forward to now, for the past year or so i have noticed some small spots at the top of my breasts, and three big dark spots right in between my breasts. They have not gone away but have actually grown bigger. I have read this might be Acanthosis Nigricans, as these spots are similar to the ones i used to have on my chin and they have the velvet-like texture with hyperkeratosis. I have noticed this is a symptom of pre/type 2. 

My question is, has anyone had similar symptoms before being diagnosed? Should i get tested?

jnyyx0,MyDiabetesdiet,2020-11-04 7:46,"This question became on of the FAQ in current diabetes world. The Covid-19 pandemic is proving to be the defining event of 2020, affecting almost every nation across the globe. The pandemic has dealt a brutal blow to the world that cannot be underestimated: more than a million lives lost by October 2020, businesses forced to shut, and severe travel restrictions crippling international travel and commerce.

The Covid-19 pandemic has struck fear in the hearts of governments and their people all around the world for two main reasons: it is very infectious, and it can kill. And because this is a novel virus (meaning to say, a virus the world has never encountered before), we simply cannot predict the long-term health effects that it will have on people who have contracted it and survived.

Statistics show that the majority of people who have contracted Covid-19 experience no symptoms, or mild symptoms only. The most common symptoms reported are fever, dry cough, tiredness, and headaches. In other words, for most people, the symptoms are no worse than the typical flu. This could explain why Covid-19 spreads so easily in the community, undetected â€“ many people who are infected donâ€™t even know that theyâ€™re infected and are hence far less likely to take additional precautions.

However, some Covid-19 patients experience more severe symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, or loss of speech or movement. Sometimes, these symptoms are severe enough to warrant hospital admission â€“ even admission into the intensive care unit (ICU).

**Diabetes Management in The Times of COVID-19**

If youâ€™ve been diagnosed with diabetes, you know that this condition **requires daily monitoring**. You need to **take your medication as prescribed, watch your diet carefully, and make sure that you maintain a healthy lifestyle.**

Making sure your diabetes is well-controlled is **even more important** during the Covid-19 pandemic because any long-term illness that you have puts you at a greater risk of suffering serious symptoms if you contract the virus. As many of us with diabetes know all too well, **diabetes is an illness that can easily slip out of control if we let our guards down.**

With this pandemic around, we canâ€™t afford to let that happen.

However, we do have some good news. In an informational article on how Covid-19 impacts people with diabetes, ADA states, â€œyour risk of getting very sick from COVID-19 is likely to be **lower** if your diabetes is well-managed.â€

This means that one of the best preventive measures you can take as a diabetic patient is to **do everything that you can to ensure that your diabetes is well-controlled**. This involves, as we discussed earlier, taking your medications as prescribed, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and paying more attention to your diet.

One of the best ways to stay fit is to watch what you eat; ensure that you eat healthy foods that are nutritious and not too high in sugar. Remember â€“ eating healthy doesnâ€™t have to mean eating foods that you donâ€™t like! With some planning, you can have a healthy diet that is both tasty and flavorful.

Maintaining a healthy lifestyle while diabetic is entirely possible. With the Covid-19 pandemic still circulating, make sure that you take **all the necessary precautions**. Remember, simply **ensuring your diabetes is well-controlled goes a long way to fighting this deadly virus.**",Topic 5,20-Nov,covid,/r/diabetes_t2/comments/jnyyx0/is_diabetes_a_risk_factor_for_covid19/,Is diabetes a risk factor for Covid-19?

jz2iuc,wrestlingandpizza,2020-11-22 12:11,"Hi. I was diagnosed with T2 about two years ago with a 10.2 A1C - my symptoms were a lot of thirst and frequent urination. I was able to get it mostly under control - but embarrassingly enough I didnâ€™t go back to the doctor. I lost my mom to diabetes complications when she was 52. She never took control or took care of it and Iâ€™m 37 and I donâ€™t want to do that. 

I have my blood test and an appointment with an Endo this week. 

But over the past two weeks Iâ€™ve gotten very serious and adopted a low carb diet (Iâ€™ve also lost about 20lbs this year and am pretty thin now) and have been monitoring my blood sugar multiple times a day. My fasted glucose has ranged from 98-110 and my after meals has ranged from 115-150 about an hour after a meal and then usually settles around 110 at a random point in the day. Iâ€™m also on Metformin. 

I guess my question is - are these numbers ok? What can I be doing to get them even lower? Iâ€™m keeping my carb count to about 50-75 a day. I run 3miles 4-5 a day and have been doing intermittent fasting as well. 

I know my doctor will have more answers for me but I really wanna do my best to avoid as many future complications as possible. Any guidance on these numbers?

I immediately cut out all simple carbs from my diet, started doing the DASH diet, and walking more. Covid made gyms a no-go, so I started hiking at a local wilderness park. So far have lost about 35 lbs and I feel much better, i no longer have those high blood pressure headaches. 

I haven't gotten checked out officially yet, as I need to find a new doctor. Was never on meds, just a diet change. I will probably buy one of those blood sugar devices soon, as I need to make sure my numbers are actually dropping.

My biggest challenge so far was just cutting out simple carbs. I never realized it before but it is shocking just how much food and snacks are purely simple carbs. I had to really research and even change where I get my groceries from just to accommodate my new diet. I rarely eat fast food now, and cook at home WAY more often. I'm even finding new recipes to try and have fun cooking now.

Part of the dash diet is eating alot more plants, especially high in fiber. However my family eats a shockingly little amount of veggies, if at all, so often times I would have to simply refuse thier dinners because of how much simple carbs it had.

So I will tell you guys a little about me. 36, RN, t2 diabetes in my paternal family. My grandmother actually lost both her legs and was on insulin in her 30s. I get my a1c checked yearly my whole life. I've always been fat. I have PCOS, I just took birth control for that, tried metformin once when I was younger and it didnt agree with me. I have anxiety, non medicated I can usually work through it now that I'm older, and I have high blood pressure, - medicated, and recently slightly elevated cholesterol. 

So last feb, my a1c was 6.4. Over the passed year I felt like I have been on the verge of getting a yeast infection off and on, I'd take otc stuff and probiotics just to keep comfortable. In march I went to the obgyn who wasnt mine because they where working half staff due to covid and she told me I was just allergic to my boyfriend of 2 years ejaculant. So that's what I chalked my unbalance and discomfort to. I also since then would just be sooo thirsty like I couldnt get enough. So I was at work and my boss was like take your bs so I did about 4hrs after eating and I was at 377. I went home did laps in the pool and ate tuna with mustard for dinner then saw my dr the next morning. He put me on januvia and glipizide. 

I immediately went low carb no extra sugar and my body was a mess for 3 weeks. 

I since got off glipizide,  my fasting bs is 100-120. My dr added ozempic in Hope's of weight loss.

I do mess up my diet every once in a while, and I dont excercise. I know I need to work on these things.

It sounds like you're doing what you can right now, and really a healthy low carb diet makes the biggest difference for management (of course you should check your bg 2 hours after eating to make sure your meals aren't spiking you too much). 

But as far as exercise go, I'd think being a nurse you're proably on your feet all day, right? That's exercise right there. Sure you can always do more but really, diet and meds make a huge difference on their own.

One thing it doesn't describe terribly well is his actual recommendation. Yes he talks fasting, but what he omits from the book (and most of his talks) is that when he says fasting, he's talking medically supervised fasts typically starting at 3 days in a cyclical pattern for potentially years all the way up to month+ long water fasts. When he says he can get people off medication in 2 weeks, it's because they're literally eating nothing and drinking only water for those 2 weeks. If done unsupervised that can be hella dangerous.  

So while basic 16:8 intermittent fasting is a great way to get your numbers under control, if you really want to reverse the diabetes you're gonna have to go at it pretty hard, and that's gonna require a doctor to monitor it.

ggphjxr,lveg,2020-12-22 9:09,"Different foods hit you at different rates, and I can't tell you much more than that. But, for instance, fat slows down absorption so it might minimize a big spike, but then it'll take a while to digest and go down. An example is that I can eat thin crust pizza (in moderation, still 30-40 carbs) and be in the 130's-140's 2 hours later, but then I can check again at 4 hours and still be there. I didn't get a big spike between tests, it just takes a while to digest. Other foods, like overnight oats, make me spike at the 1 hour hour mark but my blood sugar is lower than when I started at 2 hours. All of this is why I'd like to get a CGM, btw. 

My general strategy is to test at 2 hours because, even if there are foods that spike me at 1 hour before going back down, I consider that not a big deal because it doesn't last long. But if I'm eating something I shouldn't, I tend to test at 2 and 4 to get a better idea of how long a spike lasts. 

I will say you might want to take a closer look at how many carbs you're eating because pozole, corn chips, and churro could probably add up fast, but I think you know that considering you said it was ""moderate"". My issue with corn chips - and I love them - is that a serving is so damn small, and you can rake in carbs fast. Next time I'd stick with either the soup or the chips. 

But also, I wouldn't discount the possibility that this is still a side effect of Covid if you're seeing these kinds of spikes regularly.

Furthermore, why do populations such as Loma Linda &amp; traditional Okinawans who eat about 70-80% carbs, &amp; 95% carbs have incredibly low-rates of diabetes, obesity, cancer, &amp; heart-disease, but the highest life-expectancies in the world (80+)?

I'd assume if you took me up on my advice though, you'd eat more carbs unless you want to experience stomach aches &amp; hunger.

I have been diagnosed with T2 early this year, due to genetics (all my father family has it) and with the lockdown and the pandemy I started working 14 hours sit down in a chair and that triggered I suppose.

I dont have a sweet tooth only from time to time but coped it with non-sugar sweeteners the hardest part was avoiding sugar on asian cousine but well.. after all is a disease and not a trip to the beach lol

But now with the holidays coming up just realized that atleast in my country (argentina) christmass is all about eating candy, or sweets such as mantecol (a mixture of peanut butter suggar and nuts) pastry and even drinks with high glucemic content.

I have my T2 controlled very well, when I was diagnosed my a1c was 12! and now after changing my diet to keto and doing excercise my latest a1c (2 weeks ago) was 5!

&amp;#x200B;

And here is my question.. how acceptable or how should I calculate the suggar amount of any given sweet or pastry to be ""safe"" to eat like ONE TIME only.. literally would by one time only.

I am on  dapagliflozina 10mg every day and metmorfin dbi-ap 850mg.

&amp;#x200B;

I know is idiotic to want to eat sugar which is literaly poison for diabetics, but the cravings and the culture and tradition is passing its toll.. I fell the outcast of the holiday in my family and if I didnt get depressed when I found out about having T2 now and in this season of the year i am having it pretty hard and think that eating something with sugar as ""normal"" would help but dont want to mess up with my condition.

Is is stupid to want to eat something with sugar? or could I eat ""X"" amount and still be kind of safe?

thanks, sorry for the bad english tho",Topic 1,20-Dec,covid,/r/diabetes_t2/comments/kiutz8/first_holiday_with_t2_it_is_acceptable_to_eat_a/,First holiday with T2 it is acceptable to eat a bit of sugar?

Took vitamins daily. C, D, and Zinc, as well as a general vitamin powder.

Ate good meals, packed with veggies, even if I wasn't that hungry. Like vegetable soup, or quiche.

Drink water. I was trying to force water in me every time I was awake. Especially important because I was asleep, NOT drinking water for so long.

I took expectorant, like mucinex,  even with some slight sniffles because my colds tend to migrate to my chest.

gj8soqw,rharmelink,2021-01-14 8:52,"&gt; Why can't we control diabetes by only limiting carbs instead of going totally in keto?

That's a possibility.

&gt; the biggest criticism that keto gets is that we don't know about its long term effects.

We're currently seeing the long-term effects of the standard American diet, and the focus of low fat. :(

Little we eat today has been tested long term. Between selective breeding, soil depletion, water pollution, air pollution, pesticides, herbicides, climate changes, and whatever, foods are different than they used to be. Have you seen the ancient versions of the common foods we eat? Many are unrecognizable.

When I was a kid, we had watermelon seed-spitting contests at every 4th of July picnic. What else was lost or added from watermelons when they used selective breeding to get rid of the seeds? Selective breeding can even create dangerous foods (e.g. Lenape potatoes).

A few years ago, an Australian zoo stopped feeding fruit to their animals. They were getting obese and having their teeth rot, because fruits have been selectively bred to have a higher and higher sugar content.

Many vegetables wouldn't even exist without selective breeding -- cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, kale, kohlrabi, Brussels sprouts, collard greens, ...

&gt; Also, during last 4 years, were you ALWAYS strictly on keto or did you change your macros etc once your A1c got under control?

Not always strict. Especially since Covid, because I live in a retirement community where meals are provided. I used to be able to special order my meals to account for keto. Once our dining room was closed, we pretty much got whatever was delivered for meals.

And, yes, my blood sugars are up a bit as a result. I did stop eating the breakfast items -- French toast, pancakes, waffles, bagels, sweet rolls, potatoes, etc.

Quitting smoking now is one of the best things you can do for your health overall.  In a relatively short period of time you can reduce your risk of heart disease (which being diabetic increases), lower your blood pressure and improve your sense of taste and smell.  

I mentioned the last two because food is going to take on new meaning for you.  Having the ability to really taste/smell what youâ€™re eating can make the dietary changes easier.  Low carb doesnâ€™t automatically equal low flavor-but it might feel that way if your senses are dulled.

It does come with its challenges, but if you can get through those and leave cigarettes behind there is a world that opens back up to you that is 100% worth it.

gjzvfg0,buttfacedmiscreant11,2021-01-20 14:28,"Hi! So I got diagnosed at the end of October, so I'm still very new to this as well. I'm only 27, so it was a massive shock to me. I got put on metformin immediately (tapering up to 1500mg in three weeks) and told to completely overhaul my life. At diagnosis my A1c was 98.4 mmol/mol, and my blood sugar at the time was 17.4 mmol/l. 

The first couple of weeks or so were super rough - it was super overwhelming. Similar to how you described, I had many nights where I was up late having anxiety attacks about it all and feeling so ashamed and hopeless about it all. Type 2 diabetic at 27? It felt so grim, embarrassing and bleak. There was so much to adapt to and so many changes at once that I couldn't keep up and it felt overwhelming.

Now I'm only three months on, but things are a lot more positive. My 7 day blood glucose average is 5.1 mmol/l. I've not had a repeat Hba1c yet, but the app I use predicts it to be 31.7. Yes, I have had to make dietary changes, yes I do have to take medication, yes I have to test my blood sugars and yes I do have to make myself exercise. However, none of it is anywhere near as bad as I expected it to be.

I had some pretty rough GI side effects of metformin for the first month but now my body tolerates it really well and I have no side effects whatsoever. It works fantastically for keeping my sugars in check - even on days when I have a bit of a treat, I don't go too high outside of normal range.

The dietary changes have been the hardest part but equally, they've not been as hard as I expected. For the first month, I went super low carb to try help get everything down as quickly as possible. After that, I've been able to relax a lot more. I can have carbs with every meal, just wholewheat versions and smaller portions. It's different for everyone, but I'm able to eat baked potatoes, brown bread, brown rice, brown pasta and porridge as long as I have about half of a normal serving size and pair it with some form of healthy fat (i also have high cholesterol so have to be careful with fat as well). None of this is to gloat, but when I was first diagnosed I was terrified of how boring it seemed that food would become. So all this is just to say that actually there aren't too many things that are completely off limits to me as long as I'm willing to have small portions or swap certain aspects (e.g. brown rather than white carbs). 
While it is the most tiring part of being diabetic, the dietary requirements mean I find myself having to be more inventive with food than I would otherwise and I find that can actually make food more exciting than it was otherwise.

Similarly, while I don't love the act of testing my bloods, I've become a bit addicted to testing because it allows a certain level of freedom with food that I didn't think I'd be able to have. If I wasn't able to test my bloods, I'd never have thought to try a baked potato or pasta or bread. Testing my blood means I'm able to come up with a tailormade library of foods that I can choose from. Sure, the finger prick stings a little bit, but to me it's worth it to know how food effects me and what kind of food day I need to have each day. For example, through testing my bloods I've learned that my blood sugar rises alot when I'm due on my period and decreases pretty dramatically once I come on. Now that I can identify this, it can guide my food choices - reigning back the carbs on the days my sugars are higher but maybe allowing myself a cheat meal the day I get my period because I know my sugars will verge on low. And if you really hate testing your bloods, once you've tested a lot of different foods you can hold back on testing because you'll know roughly how different foods effect you so can use that as a guide.

Exercise wise, I am a person who has always hated exercise. Always. And that hasn't exactly changed - ill never be someone who wants to go running or to the gym. However, now my blood sugars are under control, I have SO much more energy. I'm in the UK, and we had our first lockdown here March to June, and I most likely had undiagnosed diabetes then. It was glorious weather but my boyfriend practically had to drag me out for a short walk around our local park and then I'd be so tired afterwards because I had so little energy. Now we are in another lockdown in winter, and it's been freezing cold, raining and snowing yet I've been begging my boyfriend to go on 10k walks with me because now I have more energy, it turns out I really enjoy walking! And on days when I really can't bring myself to go out in the horrible weather, I often find myself just dancing round my house for ten minute bursts. I also got myself a little exercise bike (it's not a proper one, just one of the under desk ones) that was pretty cheap (about Â£30) and is great for days when I'm feeling a bit low energy because it is very easy exercise. It might not be the most impactful exercise but its better than nothing, and I can do it while sitting down watching TV. 

This has been long, but i thought it might help to hear from someone else who is early in their diagnosis too. I don't love having diabetes but getting diagnosed with it is actually one of the better things to have happened to me, because now that I'm treating it I feel a hundred times better in myself. I didn't realise how rough I felt before diagnosis, and now just having so much more energy I feel like a completely different person!",Topic 3,21-Jan,covid,/r/diabetes_t2/comments/l1bpk0/alone_with_new_diagnosis/gjzvfg0/,0

This didnt do me hard when i was training as I did intense workouts and seemed to make gains that many would consider near impossible whilst being natural, I'm now starting to think it may have been due to my pre t2 insulin response and such ?? maybe someone more clued up might be able to explain it.

But im 100% sure that whilst in lockdown to keep my muscle i maintained my eating habits but with the lack of excercise to burn it off/use it up and also my genetics with family members also having it... is when i've went into t2 levels as my symptoms began whilst on lockdown.

l3f90d,pavic131,2021-01-23 8:30,"I was diagnosed with t2 in August when my a1c was 6.7. 

Yesterday, I got a new set of bloodwork results back and my a1c is 5.5. 

I was on Trulicity for 3 months, and during that time I never had a single read over 130. Morning values were between 95 and 105, and post eating values in the evening were generally in the 90s. I tried to eat well (have not had sugars or any bakery/pasta products all this time) and I did intermittent fasting. I lost 20+ pounds in 3 months. 

Trulicity was keeping my appetite down, but it was causing severe constipation and in time I developed a serious allergic reaction to the shot (the area of my shots would get very swollen and read for a few inches around the spot and it would not go down for a week or so every time). Trulicity was also not covered by my insurance, so I had to get it through a discount card, but that seemed like a temporary solution. I asked my doctor to change me to something covered by my insurance, which is Metformin. 

I did my bloodwork the day I stopped Trulicity and started metformin (a couple of days ago). Since then, I have taken Metformin ER 500, a tablet/day to get my body adjusted to it. 

My hunger seems to be increasing, but that is not my only concern. My values this morning were of 116, slightly higher than with Trulicity. Yesterday, however, I also had my first low in the 60s because I took metformin in the morning while I was fasting. 

I understand that next week I am starting to take 2 pills of metformin a day, so my morning numbers might be lower, but these values still scare me. I want to keep my a1c of 5.5 and not fall into diabetic values again. 

My questions are: 

Those of you who switched between these two medications, could you please share your experience? Do you have any tips about how to work around metformin when fasting? Does metformin increase your appetite to the point where you gain weight again?

l4ksbt,MaxioCel,2021-01-25 1:55," The COVID 19 pandemic has affected lives across the globe in ways previously unimagined.Â For healthcare facilities and providers, COVID 19 patient care has been a top priority since the outbreak started. This has led to many other essential services like wound care being affected.

Wound management is extremely crucial for patients having chronic, heavily exudating wounds. Diabetic foot ulcers, venous ulcers, and wounds related to Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) mostly affect the limb extremities, and especially the feet. If neglected, wound infections can cause complications that affect the overall health of the patient.

COVID19 â€“ risk to wound care

* Taking care of wounds of the lower limbs is important since these are highly prone to infection, even while walking around at home. Regular change of dressing along with keeping the limb as well as the home clean helps prevent the chances of infection.
* For people having diabetic neuropathy or PAD, it is extremely essential to keep a check on their skin for cuts and bruises. In case of such occurrences, the area must be cleaned and covered immediately, and the consulting specialist must be requested for directions on further actions.
* Prevention of wounds goes a long way in avoiding complications. Easy ways of taking care of skin at home, like keeping the skin clean and wearing comfortable shoes, can help keep cuts and infection at bay.
* Travel, unless necessary, is not recommended for people having large, chronic wounds. The chances of infection with airborne microbes increase when wounds are exposed to unhygienic environments. Traveling to wound care clinics at large distances from home can increase the risk of complications.

gl3jdr9,AdvancedNutrition,2021-01-28 7:03,"It recommends 45-60g of carbs per meal because it's based on the idea that t2 diabetes is a progressive irreversible disease that you have to manage with medication and there's nothing you can do. However, the amount of carbs you eat is the biggest and the most important regulator of your blood glucose and insulin. 90-100% of carbs that you eat get broken down into glucose (sugar). Obviously, eating less carbs decreases your blood glucose and the need for medication. 

My type 2 diabetes coaching clients are on 50g of carbs a day, they also fast regularly, eat only natural whole foods following my meal plans and manage to put their type 2 diabetes into remission withing 1 month ðŸ‘Œ eating less carbs is the most logical approach. However, not everyone wants you to know about this, as keeping diabetics on medication and telling them it's irreversible and progressive is a a way of making a lot of profits for the pharmaceutical companies that closely work with doctors and dietitians.

This common dogma of the medical community came from an Iowa State University food sciences web page less than a decade ago:

&gt; ""The minimum recommended intake of carbohydrates **necessary for survival** is 130 grams or 520 kcal per day. However, this level is recommended only to support the central nervous system, red blood cell production, and tissues dependent on glucose; **it does not support any physical activity**.""

It's pretty much where the standard guidelines of ""40-45 grams of carbs per meal"" comes from.

I do r/keto (less than 20 net carbs per day) for control of my blood sugars. If 130 grams of carbohydrates per day were necessary for survival, a lot of us using keto would have been dead years ago.

Before keto, I had an A1c of 7.3 while using both insulin and metformin. Since starting keto over four years ago, I no longer use T2D medications and my A1c has been as low as 5.2 without them. I was able to stop insulin immediately and weaned off the metformin months later.",Topic 4,21-Jan,noncovid,/r/diabetes_t2/comments/l6h0gp/how_many_carbs_should_i_be_eating_a_day/gl4d63q/,0

There are some implications of illness for your BG control, largely if you're T2, but none are in the ""far out"" category. For one, you'll probably experience a ramping up of the adrenergenic system, which also controls immune reactions, thus a liver dump during rest hours. That means, again very simply said, you'll have higher post-prandial and resting blood glucose levels than you'd usually have.

Nothing to worry about, keep your metformin/other meds at their normal level, and just ride it out. If you spike over 400 call or see your endo, keep it relaxed for that time, and try to eat but keep glucose/carbs very low.

Note, that this is a 1:50k chance of happening. It's not the end of the world when it happens, but let your GP/Endo know next time you're in for an A1c test, so they don't worry if you should show a spike.

Generally, your immune system won't have a direct impact on your glucose management, at least not more than you'd usually experience when sick. Don't worry, and thanks for getting vaccinated.",Topic 7,21-Feb,covid,/r/diabetes_t2/comments/lpabx3/side_effects_with_2nd_pfizer_or_moderna/gob83mc/,0

Look at it from a slightly different direction. As people with diabetes of any type we might have have at least a slightly compromised immune system. I have hypogammaglobulinemia but the doctors don't know whether that is related to my T2 or something else.

There are a host of possible contagious conditions we all encounter daily ranging from colds and flu to much nastier things. But we survive. Partly that is simply because the odds are low for everyone but it helps that because of our diabetes most of us are a lot more conscious of hygiene and general health matters than the general population.

Whether you are in Dublin, Sydney or Los Angeles or a hot spot like Korea or China you have far more chance statistically of catching a cold or flu or being run over by a car. 

Take sensible hygiene precautions and live your life normally. 

PS Be aware that face masks do very little to stop you catching anything at all but do aid slightly in reducing transmission of the condition from you to another.

fj7pyjy,alan_s,2020-03-01 12:48,"&gt; just so you're aware, many people argue that prediabetes is basically bunk

And many others argue that it is already early diabetes.

&gt;The most recent long-term epidemiological surveys show that only 5 to 10 percent of patients labeled prediabetic actually progress to diabetes, with a full 50 percent of people reverting to normal glycemia in follow-up visits. 

There is no link in the article to any of those long-term epidemiological surveys. I would like to see the actual studies and their methodology before accepting that claim.

&gt;It is normal â€” indeed, it is statistically likely â€” to have blood sugars that temporarily read in the prediabetes category. On your period? Had a happy hour cocktail? Stressed? Your blood sugar can spike or drop by as much as 20 mg/dL hourly.

Similarly for that nonsense claim. Those events might raise a non-diabetic's blood glucose but not above diagnostic levels.

If you can find them I would be very interested to read the full texts of any peer-reviewed studies from respected journals supporting either of those claims.

26 M here. I've been a diagnosed type 2 for about a year and a half. The past two weeks my BG hasn't gone over 300, but I had a long period where it was over 200 for quite awhile.
I guess you could say that the whole coronavirus thing had me scared straight. I'm working from home and find myself only really eating at meal times and working standing up, walking around the house when possible (I work on events so ny workload has basically been nonexistent).
That being said, I did want to know what a ""safe"" range for BG is as to not harm my immune system. I've been getting plenty of rest and drinking TONS of water. Again, paranoia since the daughter has daycare (only 5 or 6 kids actually there right now) and the wife works at a bank so she's out and about, but their lobby is closed.
How worried should I be? Biggest fear is not seeing my 6 year old grow up.

You shouldnâ€™t be too worried about it unless it stays pretty high all day but thatâ€™s not related to the Coronavirus.If your not moving around a lot, it will take a while to come down. If it stays high like that make sure to check how you feel physically and mentally. I use to feel sluggish when my BG was a &gt;240. Tracking can help tell when you go high/low. So it would say donâ€™t worry, but take the necessary precautions to keep you and your family safe.


Second Question:

I want to believe that Iâ€™m doing fine but Iâ€™m not. Iâ€™m stressing over the fact that I need my A1C down to a pretty 6.5% before I go to college. Iâ€™m 17F and Iâ€™ve had Type 2 for about a good 4-5 years. Diabetes has always drained my mental health but itâ€™s worse now. Before February I went to the gym 3 times a week for about 2 hours which was about 7 months. I went from 262 to 254 which bummed me out. I expected better results. On Presidents Day, I got into an accident and couldnâ€™t go back to the gym or work. A few days ago I got laid off due to the Coronavirus. Iâ€™m pretty much out of options. I was doing good until well, life happened. Iâ€™m not worried about Corona. I havenâ€™t been out so Iâ€™m not too worried about it. Thatâ€™s pretty much it. I will rejoice once this is over.",Topic 3,20-Mar,covid,/r/type2diabetes/comments/foqh1f/should_i_be_worried_and_how_are_yall_doing/flgrvcj/,0

Tried out a sample 2 week Libre to experiment with and see how different foods impacted my blood sugar levels. Some very surprising results and great outcome!



Two weeks ago I was given a sample sensor and after finding out my phone wasn't compatible ordered the sensor device. It works very well and ended up checking my blood sugar around 35 times a day on average. 



Turns out my enemy is wheat. And my greatest enemy is wheat that contains yeast! holy smokes! I went from 6.1 to 12.8 after eating a piece of bread... 



The weirdest thing was finding surprising foods that lowered my blood sugar levels. Eating egg noodles (durum wheat) and chicken livers both lowered my levels by 2. And eating the chicken livers reduced the levels for a long time... 



My favorite experiment i saved for today, A big mac combo with fries and a diet coke. I went from 5.4 to 7.8 but the thing here is that it stayed at around the 7 level for more than two hours. I had tried a small home made blueberry muffin for breakfast and it went from 6 to 9! but the spike went down real fast... 



So my thoughts are what is worse... Having the spike high in blood sugar and coming back down fast or the long medium high number from the mcdonalds. My guess is the Mcdonalds right? Wouldn't that mean higher sugar for longer == more depositing that sugar as fat in the body and more wear and tear on system to try and get the sugar down? I'm no expert obviously, would love to hear others thoughts on this. 



Thanks for listening to me ramble.



Oh yeah, the good thing! I went from 40% high blood sugar/60% normal blood sugar during the day to 8% high blood sugar / 78% normal blood sugar and 14% lower than target blood sugar! wow!

Although it is faster and easier to whip the coffee into a medium peak stage with an electric blender, you can also make this by hand using just a whisk.
This fun, tasty, frothy coffee is a food treat from South Korea, but which originated in Macau, and that is becoming popular all over the world. Why not give this a try while you are staying at home during this COVID-19 self-quarantine period?

Got my blood work done here in Canada.  Results:

A1c:  6.2

Total cholesterol: 5.09 mmol/L (or 197 mg/dL)

HDL cholesterol: 0.93 mmol/L (or 36 mg/dL)

Fasting glucose is on the money but it's just one reading one time, essentially meaningless.  HDL is def low,  your trig/HDL ratio sucks a lot, the rest is pretty much ok.

If you want to be sure you're not prediabetic, get a Kraft assay/oral glucose tolerance test  - that's an assessment of your glucose and insulin in response to a glucose challenge, usually done over 3 or 4 hours.

If you're un-diagnosed, then an A1c over 6 is typically considered ""pre-diabetes"", especially with the genetic factor you have in the mix.  .

Your fasting glucose seems good.  100mg is usually the marker for pre-d.

At 31, your metabolism will start slowing down, and with two T2 parents, and an A1c of 6.2, I'd say you could slide into T2 yourself pretty easily, but you're in a great spot to start making some small lifestyle changes to keep it at bay for a while.",Topic 2,20-Mar,noncovid,/r/type2diabetes/comments/frhunn/advice_needed_on_my_bloodwork_done_for_blood/flvwyl5/,0
flvx8vu,PolyglotTraining,2020-03-29 19:11,"If you want to avoid taking statin drugs, I'm not a fan of them personally, see if your doc is willing to write you Omega-3 Ethyl Esters instead, it's been shown to reduce triglycerides while at the same time raising HDL.   But the pharmaceutical grade stuff is what you want, over the counter Omega-3's tend to like adding a lot of Omega-6 which in my view defeats the purpose of Omega-3's as most western diets have too much Omega-6 in it in the first place.    


6.2 isn't bad, for a diabetic, but that number could be an anomaly so it's best to either wait a couple months and get another A1c or as someone else suggested a glucose tolerance test.  It's important to know what's going on because the sooner you do the sooner reasonable treatments can be applied.  I've had T2 for 26, almost 27, years now and if I knew then what I know now I wouldn't be nearly as insulin resistant and out of control without massive amounts of exogenous insulin.   


Try cutting carbs and adding more exercise, those are a couple simple things you can do to keep things in control.  If you drink regular soda, switch to water or at least diet soda, if you drink coffee add stevia in place of sugar.. little things you do every day with little modifications can go a long way.

Maybe a little light headed too. Could this be because of too much sugar in my system? Do I need to be checked ASAP? Or is it something that might pass?

I was thirsty, light headed, shaky, unable to walk without being tired, and had extreme stomach pains that me and my family brushed off as just a bad period. The biggest red flag is when i threw up and immediately felt my throat burning from the sugar my body just expelled. 

If you really want, you can go to emergency for this and get tested there since its very serious if left untreated. When i went, it was just a urine test, and they got back to me within 10 minutes to tell me i was diabetic. All the symptoms are most likely from high blood sugar, so id recommend avoiding carbs and sugar until you get confirmation if you decide to do the blood test. Just look at the nutrition labels and keep the carbs as low as humanly possible. The main carb offenders are any drink other than water and diet soda (if you ARE diabetic, diet sodas will become your best friend), bread, rice, potatoes, and anything with sugar in it. It'll suck, but do note that eggs and most meat have little carbs in them, so you can go nuts on omelettes if you'd like.

If at any time you suddenly feel extremely light headed, shaky, swaying like you had too much to drink, mood swings, or like you're having adrenaline pumped into you suddenly with no explaination, pour a small glass of juice/soda and drink it. Wait 15 minutes and try walking around again. Its your body having a low, and its very, very noticeable when it happens. I doubt you'll have a low though, but just in case, be prepared to book it to the juice.

I am by no means an expert, and this is all just from what i experienced when i was getting diagnosed. Its very much better to get it checked sooner than later, but with everything going on its much more complicated than that.

I've always had a bad relationship with food. I've tried hard to change things, but I've never managed to make things stick long term.

Last year, I was doing pretty well. I'd lost a total of about 40 pounds and at my check up, my hbA1c and fasting glucose were down in the normal range. My endo even lowered my met dosage.

I got some not so good medical news at the same time... a lump was found and needed a biopsy. I was scared and stressed (I'm a cancer survivor) and feeling a false sense of security from my check up. So I went off my diet and gained back 30 pounds. I also stopped checking my blood sugar. I did re-up my metformin dose.

I was getting back on the wagon (again) when all the coronavirus stuff started. Then I was laid off due to it and I got really, really depressed.

In addition to losing my job and feeling worthless, I also lost my insurance.

I started using food to sooth myself. I know it's stupid. But I did. I just wanted to feel better, even temporarily.

My weight stayed more or less the same, however I started getting that weird burning feeling on the bottom of my feet at night. This time, I don't think it was a b12 deficiency.

No increased thirst or urination, but I developed a weird bad taste in my mouth, right around the same time I started having bright yellow diarrhea.

I went back to intermittent fasting and CICO, as I'd had success with them before.

Sunday night, I had a ""normal"" dinner of a cheeseburger and a cup of instant mac and cheese. That night, I noticed my urine smelled funny. Sweet.

I went out and got new test strips and my fasting bg was 135, the highest it has ever been.

 Also, carbs are processed faster by the digestive track causing spikes. Protein and fat are digested more slowly. The actual goal is to ""flatten the curve"" so that your high glucose levels are lower: eat fewer carbs and more protein with some healthy fat.

gknk6e,BirthControlMethods,2020-05-15 20:15," Why is diabetes on the list of risk factors?

Almost 9 million Americans now have diabetes, and there are more than 600,000 new cases every year. About 89,000 Americans died from diabetes in 2000.  


The most common type of diabetes, and the kind you can do something about, is called adult-onset or Type 2 diabetes. It usually develops in adulthood, usually doesnâ€™t require insulin for its treatment, and is diagnosed when your morning blood sugar is over about 120 mg/dl. Being overweight is one of the major predisposing factors of Type 2 diabetes. Weight loss, especially if it is accompanied by increased exercise, often reverses many of the health problems associated with this type of diabetes, and may return you to a completely normal blood sugar level. (At this point you no longer have the diabetes diagnosis, but you are susceptible to it, and it will return if you regain the weight.) High blood pressure, which often goes together with Type 2 diabetes, usually returns to normal with weight loss.  


Diabetes causes heart disease through three main mechanisms. First, the high blood pressure that accompanies diabetes will harm the arteries as described above. Second, a diabetic is usually at higher risk from elevated blood triglyceride levels (over 200) and from lower levels ofHDL (below 35), the protective fraction of cholesterol. These two risk factors of blood lipids increase deposits of cholesterol in the heart arteries. The third risk factor is the high blood sugar itself: it isnâ€™t understood why this occurs, but as blood sugar rises, the amount of cholesterol deposited in the arteries increases.

golwgc,MichelletotheC,2020-05-22 8:55,"Hi everyone! Hope y'all are safe and staying healthy.

Bit of backstory: (I'm Female and 25years old, 186lbs)

In July 2019, My A1C level was 12.4 along with my LDL Cholesterol at 133. Hearing these news, I felt devastated and really disappointed in myself but I had no choice but to improve my health. Met up with a cardiologist and an endocrinologist as well. I went on a very strict diet which meant no fast food/soda/sweets, lowering carb intake, and exercising daily (1hr -1hr30min).

I was also prescribed Metformin 1000mg Twice a day and Atorvastatin 20mg Once a day. (To me MET 1000 twice a day felt a lot..)

In November of 2019, after weeks of strict dieting and exercising, I met up again for a follow up and saw that my A1C level dropped to 6.4 along with my LDL at 46 and Non HDL. Could've been the metformin + strict health changes that help lower the numbers. Of course this made me hopeful that with this lifestyle change I could lower my A1C levels a little bit more. 

But also seeing that my A1C levels lowered, I thought maybe I can ease up on my diet but continue to exercise daily.. But once Covid-19 happened and some mental health issues as well, I haven't been able to go to the gym for a while.. 

On April 2020, I had my blood test and my A1c level was still 6.3 (wow what a difference.)  

My goal with all of this is to lower my dosage and also maintain my diet/exercise. Even though the endocrinologist recommends NOT lowering it, I want to be able to at least try and lower it. I hear stories of people being able to lower their dosages after strict diet and exercise and I wanted to know if that was possible with me? 

Is it possible to lower dosage of Metformin for Type 2 Diabetes? Are there people who were able to maintain their A1C levels and Blood glucose readings with a lowered dosage? Does it take time and how long? 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I want to lower my dosage of Metformin and I want to know if it's possible.",Topic 8,20-May,covid,/r/type2diabetes/comments/golwgc/possible_to_lowering_dosage_of_metformin/,Possible to Lowering Dosage of Metformin?

I've followed a very similar path to you and hit 6.4 on my last blood test. My doctor has encouraged my to keep up my strict food restrictions and says in another 6 months I will likely be able to stop metformin *if* my blood sugar is in the mid-5s. My diet consists of avoiding all carbs. I've gotten used to the lifestyle so it's not too hard anymore and my doctor has credited it for the bulk of my progress. Your progress is likely similar, the pharmacist had said metformin will help reduce A1C by 2 - 4 points, so the rest of the drop is all you! When you reach the 5s your doctor will likely start reducing metformin by 1000mg and monitor it the next 3 months, if it stays low they'll drop again until you're off. Diet and exercise into the future will be crucial since they'll be your only weapon against the sugar.

Congratulations on your impressive achievements! That is brilliant.

&gt;Is it possible to lower dosage of Metformin for Type 2 Diabetes? 

I am on the same dosage of 2000mg daily and have been for several years. Over the years I have dropped it several times as an expereiment for a few months. The difference was minor. My A1c rose by a few decimal points and my fasting rose about half a millimole (~10mg/dl). I chose to return to the medication rather than get stricter with my menu but if I ever have any side effects (I don't) I will happily drop it.

I suggest you advise your doctor you are going to have a trial for a specific period and monitor your post-meal blood glucose levels closely during that period. If the numbers start to rise you can make a decision about whether to tighten your dietary rules or go back on the medication.

In regards to my diet, I kept it REAL strict. 
I'm Korean American and there is a lot of sodium in korean dishes so my parents and I decided to reduce the amount of salt (like half?)we put when we make the dishes. 
 
But this was a rough summary of my diet:

Breakfast: 1 cup of smoothie (strawberries+carrot juice+celery juice+ bananas) 
Lunch: romaine lettuce + boiled chicken + green/red bell peppers (portion wise, it was about half of a plate?) 
Dinner: romaine lettuce + half of a steak + veggies + 1/2 cup of brown rice with beans (tbh it was more beans the rice) 
Had NO fast food or sugary drinks 
Occasionally had coffee with no milk or sugar 
Drank a loooot of water too
I would also restrict myself from eating AFTER 6 pm. (So I guess it was also an addition my own version of intermittent fasting...?) 
On Sundays after church, I would eat with friends but I would try to eat only half and save the rest for later.

Then I would go to the gym for an 1 hr(30 min Elliptical/ treadmill and 30 mins of weights or swim)

Just wondering, are you still taking medication?  Last August, the doctor told me I was diabetic.  That day, I cut out carbs.  I have a fear of needles, so it takes me 3-5 times to even test my blood sugar.  I had been eating 2 biscuits 3-6 days a week (BOGO at at least one of the  4 fast food places in town) and subs/sandwiches at least 3 days a week.  Never was a huge sweets fan.  My grandparents on both sides of my family had diabetes also.  Anyways, my A1C was 11.5, bs was 289 iirc in the Dr's office.  I was on Metformin for about 3 months, between the medication and hardly any carb intake, it dropped down into 5.5.  I've started doing IF at least twice a week, but have stuck to the low carbs (I've found myself cheating maybe once or twice a week lately).  Since corona, I haven't been back to see him.

howm8e,biffnix,2020-07-10 13:33,"I swear, doing 16:8 Intermittent Fasting is a game changer for me. It's easy, costs nothing, and now all my markers have improved. My blood pressure is down to 129/62, and it's never been lower than that since high school (I'm 55 now). I've been on Victoza, Jardiance, and Januvia for several years now, my doctor says I can drop the Januvia until the next checkup. If my numbers continue to improve, then I may be medication free for the first time in two decades!

My last blood test revealed:

* Chol - 151 (target is &lt; 199 - **was 213 on Mar 27**)
* Triglyceride - 67 (target is &lt; 149)
* HDL - 43 (target is between 40-60)
* LDL - 88 (target is &lt; 100 - **was 165 on Mar 27**)
* VLDL (Calc) - 13 (target is &lt; 30)
* Chol/HDL ratio - 3.5 


**CORONARY RISK GUIDE: (Cholesterol/HDL)**

RISK | MEN | WOMEN
---|---|----
1/2 Average | 3.43 | 3.27
Average | 4.97 | 4.44

3X Average | 23.99 | 11.04
 
*Suggested by the National Cholesterol Education Panel.  High levels may be
mitigated by HDL values.  Consult your physician.

So, my LDL plummeted from 165 at the end of March, to 88 July 6.  My fasting glucose levels are all at or around 120mg/dL now.  I saw the change within **days** of starting Intermitten Fasting at a 16:8 ratio.  If you've ever felt hopeless about the ""eat less, move more"" advice, I understand.  I've gone through countless cycles of strict dieting, getting some improvement, then backing off the dieting and getting worse glucose numbers than ever before.  I've had some readings over 300mg/dL, and an A1C of over 11 over the years.  It's always caused pain and guilt.

But, knowing that just moving away from a constantly ""fed"" state, and just delaying a satisfying meal absolutely worked for me.  It wasn't magic, and it's allowed me to drop one of my medications already.  For the first time since my diagnosis, I am hopeful for the future.  There is a path ahead that doesn't end with more medication, possibly having to inject insulin, gaining weight, and then dealing with more disease and suffering.  It's not just possible, it's pretty easy to do.  No crazy restricted dieting, no relentless exercise regime necessary.  You don't have to **do** anything, in fact.  You **don't** do something! - just don't eat for 16 hours, and eat only within an 8-hour window.  For women, it's a little easier, as you can generally achieve the same effect by fasting for 14 hours, and eating in 10.

It sure is working well for me, anyway.  Good luck to all who are in this disease.

Also if there is a history of heart disease or it's something you're concerned about, get a calcium scoring test done, even if it comes back good it's good to have a baseline level to compare to every few years.  It can let doctors know you need an intervention before it's an emergency intervention.   


I can't take statins which has caused me more problems.  But statins are overprescribed anyway, the side effects are garbage.  If you don't have a family history of heart disease, cholesterol in and of itself isn't bad, your body creates it if there isn't enough and uses it to make various hormones and in men it's how testosterone is produced.

g8xn43c,Xilanxiv,2020-10-15 13:24,"So, this is my personal experience with this, type 2 and high cholesterol and statins.

About a year ago after a routine office visit my pcp told me my cholesterol was a little high.  She said, if you weren't diabetic, I'd just tell you to modify your diet a bit and we'll watch it.  I think my cholesterol was about 175 or so.  I think over 200 is considered high.  

I know that type 2 can have more problems, or an easier times developing problems with kidney function, and I know that a lot of low carb diets will have a lot more fat, especially keto, so that can lead to higher cholesterol and heart issues if you aren't dieting properly and carefully.

But, she said to do make dietary changes, but she also wanted to put me on a ""Statin"".  Statins are what they call a group of drugs that have an certain affect and help with cholesterol.  I'm not very knowledgeable about them.  

She put me on 20mg of Atorvastatin, which is the generic of Lipitor, I think.  She said the side effects were pretty minimal long term, and this is a low dose and would help keep my levels in check.

The main side effect I've noticed is GI problems, basically I have to take fiber pills and such now, or it'll get... unpleasant in a few days.  But, my numbers have improved a lot, I have an appointment with her again soon and hope to get blood work and see how it is after a year plus.

So, I think in my case it's just a precaution, a well established med with a proven track record, at a low dose to help keep a future problem at bay.  It's like $4 a month, so it's one of the cheapest meds I have too.

Not sure if any of that is news to you, but I feel where you are at.

g8xnttb,orebright,2020-10-15 13:30,"Assuming you mean his doctor said ldl\hdl ratios are not good. That can often happen when diabetic, and it's easy to treat with diet. The important thing to note is that dietary cholesterol is not the problem, so eggs and fatty meats are fine. Your body doesn't just dump molecules straight into your blood, it makes them and the things you eat don't usually end up being the same composition when it reaches your bloodstream.

It turns out eating carbohydrates, particularly in large quantities increases the LDL in your system, causing these kinds of issues. It also makes the LDL molecules smaller increasing the chance they stick to arteries and cause heart disease. Counterintuitively, the solution may be to satiate hunger with more fatty and protein rich sources and avoid every possible carbohydrate. Since he's T2 diabetic it's already certain he's had excessive carbohydrate intake in the past so make sure old habits aren't being slipped back into. For example when you say veggies, are there a lot of starchy carb-rich foods there? Things like corn, pumpkin, potatoes, yam, etc should all be completely avoided. What are you stuffing peppers with?

l4kku6,MaxioCel,2021-01-25 1:40,"The COVID 19 pandemic has affected lives across the globe in ways previously unimagined.Â For healthcare facilities and providers, COVID 19 patient care has been a top priority since the outbreak started. This has led to many other essential services like wound care being affected.

Wound management is extremely crucial for patients having chronic, heavily exudating wounds. Diabetic foot ulcers, venous ulcers, and wounds related to Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) mostly affect the limb extremities, and especially the feet. If neglected, wound infections can cause complications that affect the overall health of the patient.

COVID19 â€“ risk to wound care

* Taking care of wounds of the lower limbs is important since these are highly prone to infection, even while walking around at home. Regular change of dressing along with keeping the limb as well as the home clean helps prevent the chances of infection.
* For people having diabetic neuropathy or PAD, it is extremely essential to keep a check on their skin for cuts and bruises. In case of such occurrences, the area must be cleaned and covered immediately, and the consulting specialist must be requested for directions on further actions.
* Prevention of wounds goes a long way in avoiding complications. Easy ways of taking care of skin at home, like keeping the skin clean and wearing comfortable shoes, can help keep cuts and infection at bay.
* Travel, unless necessary, is not recommended for people having large, chronic wounds. The chances of infection with airborne microbes increase when wounds are exposed to unhygienic environments. Traveling to wound care clinics at large distances from home can increase the risk of complications.

How to reach patients?  
Conventional channels of wound care, like wound care clinics and nursing homes, will not be operating in full capacity for a long time. This creates the need for alternate ways to deliver specialized care to patients in need.

* **Telemedicine** â€“ This method of patient care, although not a full-fledged substitute for in-person physician care, has proved to be extremely useful in catering to patient needs at large physical distances from the doctor. The pandemic has led to the possibility of its expansion into newer sections of healthcare. Consultations with a wound care specialist, accompanied by the sharing of images of the wound can help in updating the progress of wound care regimes or new developments.Â 
* **Home care** â€“ Deployment of home wound care providers, either resident or part-time, can help patients receive personalized care. Although there might arise issues related to social distancing and physical contact, this model of care can be effective with specialized hygiene measures in place.
* **Self-care** â€“ Taking care of wounds at home with Advanced Wound Dressings (AWD) can help manage exudate and promote healing. It is advisable to consult a specialist before using any product on the wound. The choice and number of wound dressings required to depend on the type of wound and co-morbidities of the patient. Primary caregivers, as well as patients, must regularly communicate with a wound care specialist regarding cleaning and changing the wound dressing.

Proper wound care is vital for the health of patients. Medical care delivered efficiently can help improve quality of life as well as reduce complications from co-morbidities. Patients and consultant wound specialists should communicate to decide and get the required wound care delivered on-time.",Topic 9,21-Jan,covid,/r/type2diabetes/comments/l4kku6/wound_care_essentials_during_covid_19_alternate/,Wound Care Essentials during COVID -19: Alternate Care

ll2rp7,ParticipantReq,2021-02-16 4:26,"Hi everyone,

I am a final year undergraduate student of Applied Psychology in Cork, Ireland. I am looking for some participants for a research study I am conducting as part of my final year assessment entitled ""a qualitative study of middle to older adults concerning the impact of living and coping with Type 2 diabetes"". My research is on the topic of diabetes distress (ie. the emotional and mental impact of managing type 2 diabetes). My aim for this research is to inform healthcare practice and supports given to those with Type 2 diabetes throughout diagnosis, treatment and management to reduce diabetes distress.

I am looking for people living in Ireland, aged between 40 and 70, with diagnosed Type 2 diabetes (1 year+). Participants must be able to engage with a 45-minute interview online.

Diabetes distress research amongst Type 2 adults is particularly lacking in Ireland, with most studies focusing on other types of diabetes or age categories. As such, your participation would make a much-needed contribution in this area and work towards building services and supports that work for you.

If you are interested in partaking, or would like some more information, please email Abigail at 118433286@umail.ucc.ie

This study is being carried out under the supervision of staff at University College Cork (UCC) and has been granted ethical approval by the School of Applied Psychology Ethics Committee at UCC.

gnsnhln,TheFeshy,2021-02-17 11:01,"&gt;i don't understand why you need 2 jabs too like r they the same or different.

They are the same, but your body needs sufficient exposure to build up an immune response.

I don't know about the covid vaccine in particular, but for most it comes down to statistics.  For instance, a vaccine might give 60% of people immunity on the first jab, and 90% of people on the second, and 95% of people on the third, and so on.  No matter how many times you get a vaccine, there will be some people who do not respond to it (my wife has no response to the hepatitis vaccine, for instance, despite having had it *nine* times due to working in health care!)  on the other end, giving everyone one dose would still leave 40% of people exposed - which isn't enough for herd immunity to stop the spread of the virus.  So two jabs is likely the ""statistical sweet spot"" of this vaccine.

&gt;I feel if im already unwell if i take something that could give me probably more side effects and make me feel worse

Do you have specific symptoms that you are worried will be worse?

I have two suggestions on this:  One is, I've talked to a few type 2 diabetics who have gotten the shot, and all report some arm pain and not much else.  The second is, putting it off until you get your blood sugar under control puts you at *great* risk.  Anyone who has had covid while in a high-risk category would absolutely trade some sniffles, or a headache, or whatever specific symptoms you're worried about.

The only thing getting your sugars under control is going to help with is the diabetes-specific symptoms, not vaccine symptoms.  I haven't heard of anyone having a worse reaction to the vaccine due to diabetes.   You might as well be safe from covid while you're getting your blood sugar under control - it's one less thing to worry about, and stress is a negative factor in controlling blood sugar!

&gt;been working since this whole pandemic and never had any problems

That's how it goes though, right?  No one has any problems with covid - until suddenly they have *big* problems and it's too late to take precautions.

If I can be honest for a bit?  It sounds like you're afraid of needles.  There's no shame in that; plenty of people are!

The vaccine basically makes your immune system boot up to fight what it detects as a threat, but as we know with vaccines there's nothing really harmful, it just fools your immune system into thinking there is. This causes a minor fever, some chills, etc... because those are things *your body* does when fighting any virus. If a boxer is practicing against a bag instead of an opponent they still sweat and heat up, this is no different.

But the dawn effect seems to be gluconeogenesis. The liver is making new glucose (from fat).

I've done some long fasts, and have found that the dawn phenomenon becomes smaller the longer or more frequently I fast.

Getting rid of stored body fat is great. But there are more efficient ways to do it than gluconeogenesis (such as mitochondrial uncoupling through burning of saturated fat).

lpo2fd,pagingdoctorboy,2021-02-22 5:33,"HI folks,

So, I was diagnosed 5 days ago on Wednesday.  Went in for my physical.  Doctor called back that afternoon to say that my A1C was 11.1 and my fasting blood sugar was 256.  ""Floored"" is an understatement.  Was put on 500 mg metformin twice a day.

I am a 47yo woman; married; 2 kids (9 and 11); in my 21st year of teaching middle school. Have spent the last 20 years yo-yo dieting, restricting/binging, etc.  The works.  Familiar to a lot of you.  I am 5'7"", typically 165-175 pounds (so, usually 20-30 pounds overweight, but have been as low as 140 around 3 years ago).  Have gained 20 pounds in the last 6mo (went to the doc at 195).  Bursts of activity (move around alot as a teacher; bike and hike with my kids, walk the dog for 30+ minutes each day), but I love to sit around, too.  Used to participate in yoga frequently, but pandemic stopped that...

So.  After that call on Wednesday, I dove in.  To websites.  To podcasts.  To Ted talks.  And to THIS subreddit.  I found the information here in that first 24 hours both illuminating and comforting, started a keto diet that very night and am already down 7 pounds (water weight, I know, but still feels good).  I am tracking my macros with carb manager religiously.

My doctor doesn't think it's necessary for me to monitor my blood sugar, but I followed the advice of the sub and purchased an inexpensive reader on Saturday.  Have been testing (only for two days, since that's when I got my monitor) upon waking, before a meal, 1 hour after a meal, and two hours after a meal, and before I go to bed.

Here's what confuses me.  So, this morning, I woke and tested.  My bs was 150.  I got ready and went downstairs and had some breakfast.  This is what I had: 8 slices of cucumber, each topped with a smear of cream cheese and some smoked salmon.  Reading nutrition labels and according to my carb manager, the whole meal had 5g net carbs.

One hour later, my bs was 180 (I expected this to be the peak).  2 hours later, my bs was 216.  Um.  What?  I just don't get it?  Or maybe I'm expecting results too soon?

Not asking for medical advice.  Purely anecdotal responses.  Or tell me the things I need to know that I don't know.

Thank you so much!!!

All the best!",Topic 7,21-Feb,covid,/r/type2diabetes/comments/lpo2fd/brand_new_to_this/,Brand new to this...
god57y4,pagingdoctorboy,2021-02-22 10:04,"&gt; I just think that it is insanity that doctors are not suggesting newly diagnosed people don't monitor. I kind of understand their thinking (basically over obsessing over numbers isn't good) but overall having a feedback loop will help so much more. 

Isn't that the truth!  Data is so, so important--how can anyone be expected to make decisions without reflecting on data?  I've asked my doctor to refer me to an endocrinologist so I can receive more specialized care.  I just want a partner in this who is knows AT LEAST as much as Reddit folk.

&gt; So when I was diagnosed it took almost a month before my numbers were anywhere close to being normal.  

This gives me a good benchmark.  See how things look in a month's time.

&gt; It doesn't take much, but a twenty-thirty minute brisk walk a day will do SO MUCH. If you can work up to exercise that is focused on building muscle even better. 

Good thing I have a furry walking partner!

I have seen recipes online for low carb rotis/naan using coconut flour and also frying batter made from almond flour, but havenâ€™t tried these (I eliminated these items from my diet). Lentils/beans have high carbs but they also have protein and fiber which can help slow absorption. I eat these but no other high carb item with it (like with green veggie salad or cauliflower rice). I try to add nuts in most items I eat (walnuts on salad, toasted cashews in rice). Breakfast I usually eat eggs or yogurt. If you donâ€™t eat eggs, I have also made tofu scramble for good protein. For snacks I eat low sugar Greek yogurt, nuts, cheese/crackers, cottage cheese. Also feel like veg Indian diet is very heavy in potatoes and I have been avoiding this as well, instead sub for low carb vegetables. Mostly I had to change my thinking to try to include one protein source at each meal...â€ I think usually the standard rice/daal/sabzi plate is too carb heavy without a good protein source in vegetarians.

The channel Beat Diabetes! on YouTube is fantastic.

Basically, eat low carb. Check your blood glucose before a meal, and then 1 and 2 hours after a meal. In about a month you'll figure out what kinds of foods/meals you can have that won't jack up your blood glucose.

Look up Dr. Jason Fung. He's helped hundreds, if not thousands, of diabetics reverse their condition.


If you have had previous issues with depression, look up Dr. Georgia Ede. She used to be a college psychiatrist, and she found that a lot of mood disorders were reversed through elimination diets.

Of all the conditions that you could be inflicted with - type 2 diabetes is pretty benign - as long as you change your diet and lifestyle.

goppm5k,TheFeshy,2021-02-25 7:25,"&gt;I mean I understand itâ€™s too late

**It isn't too late!**  Unless you were diagnosed due to an amputation or neuropathy or something like that that is untreatable (and even then, you can halt the progress, so still not too late.)

If you simply have a high A1C, it's absolutely something you can manage.  Diet and exercise can bring that blood sugar right down, and put a halt to the development of those worse symptoms.

And it's a good thing, not bad, that you are now worrying about what the foods you eat will do to your body.  You need to be worried about, thinking about, and possibly even obsessing about, your food until you develop the eating habits that will help you.  I'm also assuming that, like most newly diagnosed type 2's, you are overweight?  In which case, hardly eating is *also* an okay first step.  So don't let anxiety over that hurt you.

Diabetes is caused by eating more carbohydrates than your body can use.  There are two big steps you can take to correct that:  The most important is to stop eating so many carbohydrates.  You're already taking steps to do that - you just need to transition into a healthy, intentional, and sustainable way of eating fewer carbohydrates. 

The first steps are, just like you are doing, thinking about and making conscious choices about your food.  And making also decisions about *when* to eat.  Eating less often, or only at certain times, is actually a quite healthy treatment for type 2 as it gives your body time to clear the glucose and lower insulin again.

As an example, personally I eat a ketogenic diet (20g of net carbs or less a day) and do intermittent fasting (only eating in a six hour window, and occasionally have full days of fasting.)  This not only controls my blood sugar, but has helped me lose a ton of weight and feel great too!    I started out with a less extreme diet (higher carbs, longer eating windows\_, but the earlier steps made it easy to cut more.

It'll take some experimentation and trial and error to find what works for you, both medically and psychologically.  Keep in mind that experimentation almost certainly involves *failures* \- otherwise it wouldn't be experimentation.  So make sure to give yourself permission to make those mistakes, *so long as you learn from them*.  Has your doctor instructed you how to use a glucose meter, and when, so you know the results of your food experiments?  Do you track your eating, blood sugar, and activities so you can compare actions to results?

The second thing you can do to help treat your diabetes is exercise.  It doesn't have to be hard exercise, but it does have to be consistent.  If you're already getting this, great!

Don't worry, it is okay to feel shocked.  I certainly was.  And scared, too - it scared me into changing my diet that same day I was diagnosed.  And it wasn't all smooth sailing, but within a month I was on the right path (and blood glucose was dropping out of the danger zone fast.)  Within a year, my glucose was normal and my eating habits had changed to the point it wasn't effort to maintain them any more (except for occasional corrective action if I start to drift from the plan.)  That fear turned out to be very beneficial - it helped me make some much needed changes.",Topic 9,21-Feb,noncovid,/r/type2diabetes/comments/ls02j7/newly_diagnosed_feel_like_im_spiraling/goppm5k/,0

2) Eat to your meter: Test your blood sugar just before you eat, eat the food, wait 2 hours, and test your blood sugar again. That will show you how the food you just ate affected your blood sugar. It's a good way to learn what to eat, and what not to eat.

lsrhm7,MollyMooSkadoo,2021-02-25 22:12,"I just need to rant. This might not be coherent.

I was diagnosed this week. I was put on metformin twice a day, and glimepiride once a day. I had an A1C of 10.6 at diagnosis, BS at 276. 

I have been crying, reading, constantly researching. I'm poor, and only got a diagnosis because of free services in my community through a virtual clinic. I won't see a general practitioner for a few months, so my questions are on hold until then. I bought my meter. I feel like shit all the time, but not as bad as before.

Before the medicine, I was dizzy constantly. I lost 24 pounds in water and muscle mass. Now I'm just weak and lethargic. I'm hoping it goes away.

I have little to no appetite. I've been drinking sodas since I was a baby, almost exclusively. Lately, I have no craving with them except at meals. It's been mostly water. I've been eating shitty foods because I'm in Texas, and all of our grocery stores are wiped out for the most part. On Sunday, my husband and I are going shopping and making lifestyle changes. I'm going to conquer my fear of needles on Monday and start monitoring my BS every morning, per doctor recommendations. I love veggies and meat almost as much as carbs, and I've never had a sweet tooth aside from sodas. This seems doable.

Here's where my issue is: I have no idea what I'm doing. I know: No carbs or sugar. I know: Try this book, or this keto, or this. What I'm saying is this:

I'm 24 years old. Existential dread is setting in. I've read that the younger someone is diagnosed, the shorter their life span. I'm falling into the pit of: ""If I'm going to die young anyway, why suffer? Why do all of this? Why not just take the medicine and hope it works well enough for a while?"" And then I think of retinopathy, amputations... I have horrible anxiety and depression no matter what direction I look in.

I'm also confused on the daily carb allotment. Most sources say 20-30 a meal, but all of these cult-like diabetic support groups I've joined said that's the max for the day.

I'm trying to find the most accurate information, and everyone tells me something different. I'm very young and haven't experienced much out of life. Aside from the existential dread, I'm trying to find information so I know what I'm in store for for the rest of my life.

This is going to take work. A lot of it. I'm not ignorant of eating a lot of meat and veggies (no roots) for life. But realistically, do you cheat? How often and how much do you cheat? 

Please... No more lectures. No more blackpills. I've read plenty, and I've given myself a lot. I just want honest testimonials and experiences, and a realistic view. Particularly if you are/were diagnosed young. I want to know what I need to do to live a reasonably long (60-70 year) life and not be absolutely miserable.

govdivm,TeaAndCrackers,2021-02-26 11:28,"My aunts and uncles who are type 2s are in their 70s-80s and are very healthy. They control their blood sugars mostly with diet, but also with metformin, same as I do.

This is my simplest advice:

1) Set a daily limit to the carbs you eat, and count them with an app. Some type 2s have 20 carbs per day, some have 50 per day, some have 100 per day, etc. (I have 50 total carbs per day, which keeps my A1c in the 5s.)

2) Eat to your meter: Test your blood sugar just before you eat, eat the food, wait 2 hours, and test your blood sugar again. That will show you how the food you just ate affected your blood sugar. It's a good way to learn what to eat, and what not to eat.",Topic 4,21-Feb,noncovid,/r/type2diabetes/comments/lsrhm7/a_rant/govdivm/,0
goxe3e7,samashx,2021-02-26 18:23,"Hi! Here to say Iâ€™m 28 and hear you. I really really really want to say our culture has failed us, food deserts cause failure in good nutrition, the food industry creates these things that make you feel full but really FUCK you up when it comes to nutrition.  Iâ€™m with you. I get it. Honestly fuck the food systems in this country. Fuck school lunches (pizza and cookies every day? And wtf frozen Jamaican beef patties? No veggies?) and fuck the fda and fuck food pyramids we were shown as kids fuck processed foods. 

I wanted to rant for a long time too. I hear you. (The existential dread might subside- idk- there will be things you learn about yourself. For me it was the best thing thatâ€™s happened to me, Iâ€™m not sick every day now that my bloodsugar is better but it still sucks because I miss a lot of foods, I know itâ€™s JUST food but like I fucking miss binge eating a cake after a bad day, Iâ€™m glad I donâ€™t anymore but I miss it) 

Anyways yes- a tip from my dietician: eat tight most days. Do the low carb low sugar but giving up your favorite things all together isnâ€™t good for your mental health. I do have cheat days. I was 7.1 when I was diagnosed. I am 28 and was 185lbs and now 145 with a 5.6 A1C. I plan a special carb/sugar/ alcohol heavy meal for myself once every 2-3 months. Iâ€™m very happy building the anticipation. And Iâ€™m happier a couple months post diagnosed too. But i slip up some times (my partner bought flavored blasted goldfish and i ate maybe half the box one night, HORRIBLE- but most days now i eat raw/frozen/canned fruit and veg- and beans a little- and a little meat). I just realized feeling better with no bread is better than eating bread. Youâ€™ll find things that work for YOU specifically. So idk I hope it gets better. This is the place to rant. 

Remember itâ€™s not your fault- itâ€™s genetic. You know who else drinks sodas like every day? Lots of people who never get diabetes haha. Itâ€™s unfair- and again fuck the systems. We are here for you. I hope you have some good up days, but your feelings are SO valid.

fjd55pb,CoralPictureFrame,2020-03-03 6:31,"I feel pretty much the same. I was diagnosed a month ago with a fasting of 7 and a1c of 7.1. Three week on 500mg metformin per day and a moderate change to my diet my fasting average is around 4.3 (77). 2hrs after a meal I'm typically between 4.3 (77) and 5.6 (101), even when having carbs like wheat pasta. I haven't tested 4 or 6hrs after a meal because I don't typically leave that long of gap between meals/snacks. I did get to 6.3 (113) after 3 slices of large pizza and I tested a high sugar meal of brownie, ice cream and melted chocolate which resulted in a bs reading of 7.9 (142) 2hrs afterwards.

I have no idea whether that's the metformin working or the slight diet changes. I know I should be happy with those numbers but it makes me feel less confident about my grip on the disease. I panic that one day I'll just wake up and my numbers will be worse, that I was simply lucky for the first few weeks.

I don't know any other T2 people, particularly in my age group (30's) so I feel very lost. I have seen a diabetes educator and the information has been fairly generic. I was advised to aim for a fasting bs of between 5 (90) - 7 (126) and 2hrs post meal between 8 (144) - 11 (198). Which doesn't seem relevant to me, at the moment at least.

fjbedfe,peaceandpeanutbutter,2020-03-02 15:23,"Think of carbohydrates like links in a long chain. Carbohydrates need to be broken down into single sugar molecules in order to enter your bloodstream and then cells to be use for energy. If you eat a complex carbohydrate, itâ€™s like eating a really long chain and it takes a little while for your body to break down the carbohydrate into simple sugars. Thatâ€™s why complex carbohydrates donâ€™t immediately spike your blood sugars, but they will raise them gradually overtime. Simple sugars can be digested extremely fast so they spike your blood sugar rapidly. (this is a simplified version of what the glycemic index refers to) basically, every gram of carbohydrate in your oatmeal will eventually be broken down into glucose molecules so your body can absorb it, hence raising your blood sugar a lot because oatmeal has a lot of carbohydrates in it.

I was prescribed jardianze, and have not had a bg higher than 190 within a month of being on the meds. I made some lifestyle changes (cut back on carbs and cut out sugary drinks). 


Anyways- enough background. I was fairly strict with my diet until the Covid shutdown. Since then my alcohol intake has increased to 2-4 drinks most nights, my sweet tooth has returned and my diet has gone to shit. My bg is still pretty low. Since being diagnosed and on medication, my bg has mostly stayed below 150. I test in the morning before and two hours after breakfast or lunch, randomly once throughout the day. I test randomly just to see where my sugar is, even if I feel okay. Sometimes itâ€™s odd - I could feel like complete shit but my bg wonâ€™t be that high - for example I took it earlier when I had a major headache and nausea and was at 147.

My A1c started off above 8 but my last two were low 7â€™s. 

Sometimes I wonder if I was misdiagnosed or if my body is secretly hiding my uncontrolled diabetes. Honestly Iâ€™m not too sure what to think.

Old man has been diagnosed with T2 diabetes. 

The scenario;

Without insulin and on his fully keto diet (veg, salad, eggs, water, lean meat), his blood glucose stays at 6.2 - 6.5 morning, noon and night. 

I find that when he does take insulin his blood sugar is 2.3 when he wakes up if he hasnâ€™t eaten  the â€œright amountâ€ of carbs the day before. 

Balancing the right amount of carbs to insulin presents this issue:

With insulin = needs carbs not to go hypo. Then overcompensates with carbs. 

Without insulin = stays at 6.2

If he's supplementing meals with fast-acting (which I assume is unlikely), I would say that that is unnecessary and that his lifestyle is ok (that isn't a terrible blood sugar level at all, if he truly isn't ever going above 6.5). Given that he was willing to convert to a keto diet, he's likely already exercising. But if not, a couple of 20-30 minute walks per day would likely be as effective as insulin for someone in his position whose numbers are already so close to ideal anyway.

If he is on Lantus/something long acting, he could cut it down by a significant amount and see if he feels better with that that (get himself riding somewhere more in the 5.5-6.5 range). I won't tell you how to do that because people's dosages and sensitivities are so different, but cutting it back by about half to start would be what I would do for myself.

Especially because he's chasing the dragon of diabetes perfection and not trying to mitigate a hyperglycaemic catastrophe, he can afford to back off a lot and re-introduce a bit-by-bit without the fear of rocketing himself into the teens.

Insulin and food intake is a matter of balance. If he eats excessive carbs he needs an appropriate dose of insulin to match the consequent blood glucose spike. If he eats very low carb (e.g. keto) an insulin dose intended for a higher carb intake will drive him low.

And then I got a new meter through my insurance. I was using Walgreens brand TrueFocus (the one with 50 strips for $15) and then last week got a OneTouch Ultra.

In July of last year I took a tumble while mountain biking, and over the course of a week or so, a gash I had on my arm became more and more painful to the point that I eventually checked myself into the hospital.  It had become infected, and after a complete blood panel, my results came back with a blood sugar level of 285.  The on-staff physician immediately informs me that I have type 2 diabetes, and gets me going on a regiment of 500mg of metformin twice a day.

This was fairly shocking news, as I have always led a pretty healthy lifestyle, and eat much healthier than average.  That said, I do have type 1 diabetes in my family history, and his response was 'sometimes it just happens'.

Ok, he's a doctor and knows better than I do, so I take my script and head out with a 6 month follow-up scheduled.

Fast forward to last week, I visit my doctor for the follow-up, and he asks me what my blood sugar monitoring has looked like.  I inform him that I've never seen my sugar levels surpass 135, even a couple hours after a large meal and a few beers.  He then orders a full blood work-up which came back today.

Best thing is watch you fever and o2/breathing; everything else should be manageable via OTC medication. If you have a pulse ox, theyâ€™re pretty helpful (I normally read 92-99 on my Fitbit, I was reading no lower than 96 with covid so I wasnâ€™t concerned even with massive congestion).

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure if this has been posted before but I am very curious on this topic. My mother was tested for Covid after a close contact at her work tested positive. Luckily her test was negative but it got me thinking. Since the start we have been told Diabetics and in particular diabetics with other comorbidities are at a much higher risk for serious Covid-19 complications and even death. Everything I have read says that T2 diabetics are at more risk than T1. I was shocked. Is this because more people with T2 live with it uncontrolled? Type 1's seem to be in control of the BG a lot more, I assume because they have to be?  Not that T2's don't but it seems that many T1's are more in tune with their levels, and many are on CGM's. I have a friend who is T1 and her endocrinologist sent an email to all of her patients saying that they should aim to have their BG's under 8.0 m/mol(144 Mg/dl) for 70% of the day and that would put them near the same as someone without diabetes, or at least far less of a chance of having serious issues if they contracted Covid. I rarely see my levels that high unless I am having a cheat meal.  My last A1C was 4.9 and have been wondering if I did contract this virus if I would be anymore at risk than a non diabetic. I cannot find much information on what happens to diabetics in the ""Non Diabetic"" range as of yet. It seems as though a lot of it has to do with how well you manage your sugars, age and other health factors.  I also have no other health issues present.

I had a similar problem like you where I was on 2500mg of metformin, gliclazide and adjusted my diet because I was labeled type 2, but I was still seeing huge spikes with random bad lows. Turns out I wasn't producing enough insulin so my dietary changes were only temporarily effective and as the diabetes progressed, I had to take more meds because my changes stopped working after they initially produced good results. The gliclazide also sent me on blood sugar rollercoasters because my insulin output was so inconsistent. I'm not type 2, I have no atypical insulin resistance (my current total daily total of insulin is about 55 units a day with an estimated A1C of just a little over 6% at this time on a high carb processed foods diet), I just don't make enough insulin.

Taubes' book ""Why We Get Fat"" actually covers this pretty well, basically discussing the massive change in prevalence from the early 1900s to now, and associates most of that with big changes in our diets from non-sugary diets to our industrialized high processed food, heavy sugar diets.

Diabetes doesn't mean we do any better at being held up to impossible standards than anyone else.  It just means the consequences are unfortunately shittier.

Also, self-blame, shame, defeat are all stressful.  Wallowing in those feelings isn't going to help.

I'd suggest some self-compassion and thinking about what other methods you have to handle stress.  Maybe breathing exercises? Meditation? Walking? Other kinds of working out?

Also, are there any lower-carb comfort foods that work for you?   I'm sure folks here have lots of suggestions for those.

Personally, as all this pandemic stuff is happening, I've been craving carbs a lot harder than usual.  It also doesn't help that my office is full of free chips and candy. So far, still eating them in relatively moderate portions, but my numbers are running somewhat higher than they typically do.

I am truly shocked at the result and even asked if it was accurate haha. I have been far less strict the last 6 months trying to find my groove for long term success and I think I have found it!

I think a key to long term success isnâ€™t cutting yourself off from foods you love, foods that may have contributed to your diagnosis in the first place, but rather the moderation theyâ€™re consumed in. I mean I used to eat a large pizza with 2L of coke in a sitting (no joke). Now I may have pizza once a month and itâ€™s maybe 4-6 slices. I also avoid sugars almost entirely. So many sugar substitutes now I find it super easy.

fjh9wat,4thshift,2020-03-04 9:47,"Most doctors receive only a handful of hours on nutrition, and most patients donâ€™t want to pay and wait to see a doctor who says, â€œyou could fix this by not eating sugar and by exercising.â€ Instead they want â€œactionâ€ and many patients feel like pill popping is easier than exercise and cooking, so who to blame for the current climate of poor health education, and less than optimal choices? It is not for lack of a unified message: eat better food, and go be active, and get your blood sugars toward normal. It is that they donâ€™t want the patients to â€œtake care of themselvesâ€ so much â€” it sets them up for criticism: â€œwhy did you not do anything for me?â€ And if the patients go Googling for keto and low carb, and the ADA guidelines donâ€™t support that, the doctor can say, â€œwell, I told you to follow the My Plate method, like he ADA recommended.â€ (Note: as of 2019 the ADA finally allows for low-carb inclusion as a healthy option.â€)

I mean, question everything, right? But sources of various beliefs and methodologies all point to this as fact: â€œmedical students get only a few hours of nutritional training in all of their years of school.â€

&gt; On average, U.S. medical schools offer only 19.6 hours of nutrition education across four years of medical school, according to a 2010 report in Academic Medicine. In a 2016 study, researchers at Case Western Reserve University examined data from 25 family medicine, internal medicine and OB-GYN medical residency programs throughout Ohio: What they found is that these programs averaged 2.8 hours of instruction on obesity, nutrition and physical activity counseling, and only 42 percent of them taught the residents techniques for how to perform health behavior counseling.

&gt; Given this, it's not exactly shocking that many doctors would receive a failing grade on nutritional know-how. A 2016 study in the International Journal of Adolescent Medicine and Health assessed the basic nutritional knowledge of fourth-year medical/osteopathic school graduates entering a pediatric residency program and found that on average, the incoming interns answered only 52 percent of the 18 questions correctly.

&gt; The reality is, it's not realistic to expect physicians to be experts on everything. ""Most primary care physicians have seven to 22 minutes to spend with each patient,"" says Dr. Christine Gerbstadt, a staff physician at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, who is also a registered dietitian. That time includes ""offering age- and patient-specific appropriate preventive health advice â€“ wearing seat belts 100 percent of the time, not smoking, eating more fruits and vegetables, avoiding highly processed sugar- and fat-laden foods, being physically active an hour a day, flossing and brushing your teeth, reducing stress, sleeping adequately â€“ the list is truly endless and must be exhausted in seven to 22 minutes, along with listening to the patient, offering guidance for recommended health screening and performing a focused physical exam,"" she says. That's a tall order, indeed.


&gt; Another factor: The culture of current medicine, ""which has increasingly focused on pharmacologic treatments, rather than lifestyle modifications,"" says Dr. Marion Vetter, an adjunct assistant professor of medicine in psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine who is also a registered dietitian. ""Both patients and providers want to see rapid results, whether it is weight change or improvements in blood glucose or lipids. Dietary modifications and lifestyle changes typically involve a slow and steady approach instead of a fast fix. For this reason, patients frequently revert to previous behaviors and tend to make few durable lifestyle changes, which may discourage physicians from spending the time to provide dietary education.""

I have found a lot of success with keto and I actually like what I eat and don't really feel like I'm on a diet.   I do suggest though that if you are overweight, ignore adding fat to everything like keto suggests because your body already has fat stored for use.  

You can check out r/keto and r/ketorecipes for ideas.

Eat to your meter: Check your blood sugar just before you eat, wait 1-1/2 hours, then check it again. That will tell you how much that particular food raised your blood sugar.
